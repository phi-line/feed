 The Librarian moved silently through her archives, cleaning up and organizing as she went. On sub level 57, she came across several stacks of books and files laid out on a table. Counselor Five had been here earlier, pouring over files. For what reason The Librarian could only guess. Five had been called away for an impromptu meeting, and while she promised to come back and clean up her mess, the Librarian doubted she would return today. She didn’t hold it against Five though. Five was a busy woman who made tough decisions everyday. 
 The Librarian begins organizing the files before filing them away on a nearby bookshelf, the files immediately becoming lost among the books as soon as they leave her hands. Then she stops when she picks up…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reconstruct Writings is a restorative spell that returns a piece of text to its original state. This includes what it was written on and what it was written in. The spell will attempt to bring together the original materials but if they are destroyed or too far apart it will replace them with magical matter at a higher mana cost. The amount of damage and the age of said damage change the effectiveness of this spell. The more damaged and the older said damage negatively affects the spells effectiveness. Resulting in progressively less legible results. 
 It's a minor spell, capable of being easily cast by most apprentices to repair paper but its usefulness is not to be understated. Any mage in a profession interacting with text should learn it. I can't tell you the amount of books I've been able to save from the consequences of a misfortunate or reckless situation with this spell alone. It has also served me greatly in archival purposes keeping decade old books and manuscripts in top condition. It's great at fixing important documents if you just so happen to spill tea over them as well
 Like many spells we take for granted despite its simple casting the inner workings of the spell are surprisingly complex, built upon many hundreds of years of magical developments. If you were to break it down, the spell requires minor oracling to identify the original components and their construction, tracking magic to find the component in the present, telekinetic magic to bring them together, transmutational magic to form It back to its original state, and finally conjuration magic to fill in any potential gaps. All of that and more has been wrapped up into an easily castable spell. So simple even a novice can use it. Every spell truly is a wonder if you only look a little deeper.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The writer thing has got to be a cover story or just his hobby. He was dabbling in arcane power, I'm sure of it. I mean, look at the stuff he said.
 “I became insane, with long intervals of horrible sanity”
 We all know sanity can be a burden at times, especially for certain advanced spells. He's lamenting the loss of that magical boost you get from the flow state of discarding sanity, and that he hasn't the skill to maintain it indefinitely.
 "Reality is the #1 cause of insanity among those who are in contact with it."
 You can't convince me that he means anything other than magic by reality, the very foundation of metaphysical existence. Mages are the most direct sculptors of reality, and indeed even non-reality. He's saying magic can cause insanity, a self evident truth to the initiated, and admits he's insane. He's basically admiting to being a wizard with these two statements, in my objectively true opinion, but if you need more convincing he also said...
 "Men have called me mad; but the question is not yet settled, whether madness is or is not the loftiest intelligence– whether much that is glorious– whether all that is profound– does not spring from disease of thought– from moods of mind exalted at the expense of the general intellect."
 The loftiest intelligence? A glorious profundity inextricably linked to madness? Forgoing the general intellect in favor of a nebulous, esoteric understanding?
 If he's not talking about magic, I'll eat my hat without transmogrifying it into a steak dinner first.
 Bro was certainly slinging spells. EAP probably actually stands for "Eldritch Arcane Practitioner".
 I rest my case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I found a tree that was being swallowed by honey suckle and had the entire top removed but it had a really nice twist. So I cut out this section. I'm not sure what kind of tree but it's definitely a nice hard wood. I peeled and dried it. Then I shaped it to my liking with a draw knife, rasps, and belt sanders. Once I was happy with its shape, I hand sanded it up to 2000 grit(probably overkill). It's 3.5 ft long and is made like an axe or mattock handle and it's weight and mass distribution are similar. So it's very comfortable in the hand and can be easily swung like an axe. Then I made a stain with 30% acetic acid/vinegar, steel wool, and black tea. Wiped it down good with the stain. Let it dry. Then sanded it again and repeated until I got the color I wanted. Finally I finished it with a layer of wax. What do you think?

 Ulrick just shook his head at this point. He crouched above the table in his office, deep within the building of the R&A HQ. The only company he had at this late hour was a bottle of whiskey. He really needed that one.
 Reading reports after reports of similar incidents put him in a bad mood during paperwork. Being the new head of R&A was even more exhausting than he thought. How could Hirk handle all of this?
