My heart pounded.
 I’m scared.

 (Stalz's POV)
  
 I managed to sail the crew away, but one. That was the fish, he's new, so why should I care, why did I care, better one man down than my crew down. No. I can’t just leave anyone behind, even if they JUST joined. 
  
 I stare back, to see how he was doing, but there was nothing, the dragon wasn’t there nor was that fish, I felt worried. 
  
 “Liam, can you go check on him!” I shouted at the shark, anxious of our new friend’s life.

Most either fought back or joined out of fear, some saw an opportunity for power and took it. Yet in Threndal, there was one who looked into the eyes of the Conqueror, one who commanded more soldiers than there were blades of grass in the realm, and felt no fear.
 Feldrin was a strange soul, from the very beginning of her life she could conjure creatures to do her bidding. For two hundred years she refined her skill, slowly learning to conjure more and more creatures. Controlling more and more powerful creatures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[nothing
 వ was wandering through, nothing, for who knows how long. He hadn’t seen another person for so long. No other voice in his head either.
 he was just, walking, on a cold, ashen, ground, for what felt like months. Though in actuality it had only been a few minutes, he didn’t know.
 looking closely, వ saw faint red dust in the air, neon in color. Core radiation. What had happened here? Not like he knew. 
 So, he walked. For what felt like eternity
 At one point, he thought he saw a cliff in the distance, in this, endless, deserted, gravel landscape, but after blinking a few times, it was gone.
 Eventually, he found something. A small hatch in the ground, only barely covered up by the dust on the ground
 “Finally, something”
 flipping open the hatch, వ descends a stairway. It’s a dusty space, filled primarily with monitors. Powered by, a battery? Seems it can run for a while.
 powering it up, it booted up to a log-on screen of, Calarakis?
 “Oh, I remember now.” he said aloud, as he unlocked the computer. It led to a backup of various files from throughout the city. Latest dating to… doesn’t even know how long ago. It’s been just, walking, for so long that the day had been forgotten. Checking the system time led it to… today? No, that can’t be right.
 Click-click.
 it’s a shot of the inside of the Core system, it showcases readings on the left. Instability, graphs overloading, then-
 white
 the camera dies.
 “So. If the world isn’t dead, I’m still probably going to die here. I can’t cast any magic with this in the air. How did I even get here? How did I survive?”
 deciding to focus on more pragmatic efforts, he comes to the obvious conclusion.
 “Very little chance I’m going to be seen. Probably would’ve been found by now if I have.”
 he sulks into the chair, as it creaks with him leaning backward.
 /uw all of this is a dream, if your character can enter dreams, they can find him. Ж’s currently wandering, just like in the other post.

 Max snapped awake at the thought, as if he had been running on autopilot this whole time
 It was all gone.
 He focused his eyes, before being overwhelmed with terror. He stared at Calarakis, at least, what was left of it. Which, wasn’t much. Evidentially the core system had detonated, he felt it. The antimagic in the air, almost, oppressive. All that was left was a crater, nearly 1000 feet deep by the looks of it. He saw the zero point floating in the middle of the crater, high above anything else.
 “This… can’t be real.”
 but it certainly felt like it. He could feel the Individual grass blades and the dirt under his feet.
 then something was noticed, that voice, వ’s, where was it? He had been completely alone here, no one else had said anything.
 then he turned around.

 It was a ...strange year here in this sub with many ups and downs, incredible amounts of joy but also heartbreak which I managed to overcome thanks to the help of others, some very valuable insight on myself and the chance to meet incredible friends along the way which I hold very close to me.
 ...but I think it is time to make it official. This is my last post on WP and its related subs. For the related chats I am in I will stay in as I like the community behind them very much. It stopped being fun and to be fair, I'm surprised that I even made it this long.
 Anyhow, before this takes on a huge scale I will head out and enjoy the taco.
 Have yourself a good one and a final Logotu out :3
