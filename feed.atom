        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oriana was looking for a potion, a certain age potion to become older. While searching she found an old temple and decided to go inside to take a look.
 Going inside she casts detect magic detecting something in the middle of the temple. She starts walking towards it activating a series of traps on the way there.
 She reaches the middle of the temple with burned robes and an arrow through her hat. In the middle there's a pedestal with a potion on it, apon further inspection the potion has a label "age giving potion" 
 Oriana: sweet!
 She takes the potion and the pedestal goes down. After it goes fully down a curse comes out in a form of mist, completely surrounding her. After a bit the mist disappears and Orioana isn't quite there anymore.
 Orion: I'm back! Let's go!
 Noiro in Orion's brain: that's nice, wait...
 Oriana in Orion's brain: what is this place? Why is it full of catgirls?
 Noiro: oh no she's here...
 Oriana: who are you? You look like me, but you're a guy
 Noiro: I'm Orion's "evil" version, it seems you're now stuck with me in his brain 
 Oriana: I'm fine with that sweetheart~
 Noiro: noooooooooo
 Orion:aw shit, here we go again

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Think of it, the only bound on your bagic being the spells you know and the time in the day you have to cast them. What would you spend your day doing? 
 I have crossed that line long ago where mana intake is far more than my output could be if I was casting 24/7 so I want a fresh take from wizards that are still working out an answer. I find how each school of magic tends to answer this with a new perspective each generation of wizards that are born to take on the line of teaching.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flufferson had one thought going through her mind.
 It was Oni.
 _____
 The door to the security room blew open, as Oni dodged the flying door.
 Oni: FLUFF!-
 Oni had just enough time to dodge a tendril of light coming to stab him.
 Fluff: WHY DID YOU DO THIS? WHY DID YOU LET THIS HAPPEN?
 Oni: W-what?
 Fluff: HERESY? SHADEHOLME?
 Oni: I knew you wouldn't let Nicole get her soul taken for the deal with He-
 Fluff: SO YOU ALLOWED GERALT TO BE TAKEN?
 Oni: What are you talk-
 Oni narrowly dodges a blast of buckshot, but...
 Oni looks down.
 He's stabbed in the chest.
 By a tendril of burning light.
 Oni: Fluff...GAGH! FLUFF! I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS! BELIEVE ME!
 Flufferson: We-We're FAMILY! WHY ARE YOU LYING, EVEN NOW?
 The tendril snaps, as a fireball whizzes past Fluff's face.
 As Flufferson turns to face the assailant...
 Oni's gone.
 _____
 Oni hobbles away, carried by Waddel.
 Waddel: Got your ass kicked hard for the demon of wrath.
 Oni: Shut up. I can only fight as well as a 6-inch penguin can. Fluff's souped up with magic artifacts and stuff, I have no counter.
 Waddel: ...Did you help take Geralt?
 Oni: I swear to god-NO! WHY WOULD I BE HERE IF SO? Its Heresy's bullshit, for sure.
 Waddel: Heresy?
 Oni: ...You are a military organization dealing with the paranormal, and you don't know Hell?
 Waddel: I do, but isn't Heresy related to-
 ____
 Heresy: Anyways, minion, the thing I need you to do...
 Pointing at a nearby village.
 Heresy: Find a potion shop there. Rob it. Get everything you can. We need the cheapest stuff possible for this ritual.
 Geralt: I can do that, I guess. 
 Geralt leaves.
 Heresy: Calling someone. Heyyyy, you know Geralt? That one guy? I KNOW, I KNOW, I'm just joking. He's actually here with me! Want to tell him? Great...
 Heresy has a knife in his hands.
 A seemingly holy glow emanates from it.

 One day he decided to visit the tavern of a village he stated in for a few months, where he met the man who taught him common and helped treat his wounds from crossing into this realm.
 He was a sentimental fool who wanted to feel like he did then. He wears a large cloak, it did not hide who he was, simply enchanted to let folks know he’d rather they forget he was there.
 “Mr Petrikov, it is good seeing you my friend, now I must remind you I was never here.”
