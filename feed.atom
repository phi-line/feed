        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Three years ago my master sent me off on my quest to study the supernatural forces in the magical forest. It had been going well for about a year, but then some clueless losers showed up about two years ago and decided to make a camp by my newly constructed tower. At first I kept to myself and thought this was going to be temporary campsite, but nope they cut down part of the magical forest I’m supposed to be studying to build some stupid cottages. Now the wood nymphs and forest spirits will not talk to me anymore because they think it’s my fault for bringing these peasants to the forest. 
 This delayed my studies and normally would not be a problem, but you see they started this group called a Cottage Owner Association (COA). This stupid association has been a pain my butt! This group insists that my tower is an eyesore! They also say it’s dangerous, but it’s not my fault little Timmy tried climbing the tower and died when he fell off. They told me to bring my tower “up to code” and remove the vines and moss growing all over it. They were also telling me that all changes to my tower must be approved by the COA. Ugh… just talking about it makes me want to disable the magical barrier and let the monsters of the forest devour all the peasants.
 I feel like there are other options that I am not considering. Are there any other wizards here that have dealt with associations like this? Any suggestions will be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summoning spells sound self explanatory on their face. You summon something under your command. In reality summoning spells are a complex and varied field with spells often being personalized to the caster. In this spell book I'll cover a few of their forms. I will focus on general summoning for less sapient creatures as summoning intelligent beings is quite complex and often heavily specialized between summons. One thing almost every summoning spell has in common in that they form a one way rift that allows the summon to appear. A similar one way rift is created to send the creature back when it's unsummoned. Besides this they can differ heavily. 
 The first and most widely used form of Summoning spells brings forth a spirit that takes the form of the intended summon. The type of spirit c…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep in the woods a man was tied to a tree, robbed and wounded, left to bleed out. The last thought that man had was wondering why, why he needed to die. Then he left this life behind. Not a minute later the man's eyes opened. But they weren't his eyes anymore. A being forgotten to history, awoken in a different body. The creature stood up, the ropes morphing into snakes, disappearing into the undergrowth. The thing examined it's body. Human, 5'11, 43 years old, dressed in rags. It wouldn't do.
 The air around the creature bent and distorted, and the man changed. On the outside the creature changed, bones cracked, skin tore, muscle ripped as something grew from within, reassembling the available materials. What emerged once the process was complete was something different. Thinner and taller than a human, limbs a few inches longer than they should be, rags replaced with a black and gold suit with a black and gold cape and a black and gold top hat. Much better, something was missing though. One of the snakes from earlier slithered over, around and up the leg of the creature, up the torso, down the right arm. Upon reaching the hand it changed, changing, solidifying into a black and gold cane, capped in a small crystal orb.
 Outfit complete, the creature stretched, aligning the limbs. Then the creature examined it's surroundings, deep woods, darkening sky, no one around. The creature took ten steps in a random direction, then decided to use a different method of transportation. Space bent and distorted, the creature took another step, and was in a town. Eerily similar to the one it performed in all those months ago. But unlike last time it wasn't a magician anymore. It didn't want to perform for the people anymore. It didn't know what it wanted. The creature walked to a bench, and sat down. Waiting for something or someone to talk to. It wanted to know what had happened since it departed.
