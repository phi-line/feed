 approaching his house, there seemed to be a work-in-progress extension of his house, quite early within the process. It seemed quite large. Wonder what that was for., and how he was going to get the materials or fund it, though he probably already had that figured out somehow.
 consequently, his shop was closed, though since he was home, the door was still unlocked and welcome to visitors.

 /UW/
 Hi, Neverra's creator here! So, I decided to actually draw the little nerd, just for the heck of it. I just wanted to put an actual face to all of the necromancer chaos here, and the design just turned out too nice NOT to eventually post. So here's a WIP just to hold y'all over to the next lorepost here, lol. 
 Sorry for how dang messy it is here; my sketches always kind of are, lol. But at least it makes sense to me. Kind of funny how this design started in the first place, though; there was a picture on Pinterest of some other kind of corset with ribs on it, and it was all just downhill from there. 😂 
 Also, I DID NOT know that I was able to actually draw vertebrae until this character design. 🤣 Literally the first time ever in my life that I've ever drawn them at all, really. But yeah, can you tell that drawing necromancers is kind of my artistic comfort zone?

The day was perfectly calm until this strange person entered the tavern, covered in pale dust and in scandalous purple robes. This drunkard - I didn't know him personally but I've heard he be called 'Sbeve', something along those lines - he made the mistake of confronting this lunatic magician. He was all in his face, hurling insults, "you look like a moldy blueberry!" I remember was one of them. The mage didn't seem to notice him at first until... Brush This guy had just rested his arm on the man's shoulder, wiping away the dust on his skin. This was when the magician snapped, his face screwed like someone had just used power word: crunch. It didn't take long until there was an orange flash, and before me was no longer the drunkard but now a round, crispy, inch long chicken nugget.
