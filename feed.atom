        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flufferson had one thought going through her mind.
 It was Oni.
 _____
 The door to the security room blew open, as Oni dodged the flying door.
 Oni: FLUFF!-
 Oni had just enough time to dodge a tendril of light coming to stab him.
 Fluff: WHY DID YOU DO THIS? WHY DID YOU LET THIS HAPPEN?
 Oni: W-what?
 Fluff: HERESY? SHADEHOLME?
 Oni: I knew you wouldn't let Nicole get her soul taken for the deal with He-
 Fluff: SO YOU ALLOWED GERALT TO BE TAKEN?
 Oni: What are you talk-
 Oni narrowly dodges a blast of buckshot, but...
 Oni looks down.
 He's stabbed in the chest.
 By a tendril of burning light.
 Oni: Fluff...GAGH! FLUFF! I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS! BELIEVE ME!
 Flufferson: We-We're FAMILY! WHY ARE YOU LYING, EVEN NOW?
 The tendril snaps, as a fireball whizzes past Fluff's face.
 As Flufferson turns to face the assailant...
 Oni's gone.
 _____
 Oni hobbles away, carried by Waddel.
 Waddel: Got your ass kicked hard for the demon of wrath.
 Oni: Shut up. I can only fight as well as a 6-inch penguin can. Fluff's souped up with magic artifacts and stuff, I have no counter.
 Waddel: ...Did you help take Geralt?
 Oni: I swear to god-NO! WHY WOULD I BE HERE IF SO? Its Heresy's bullshit, for sure.
 Waddel: Heresy?
 Oni: ...You are a military organization dealing with the paranormal, and you don't know Hell?
 Waddel: I do, but isn't Heresy related to-
 ____
 Heresy: Anyways, minion, the thing I need you to do...
 Pointing at a nearby village.
 Heresy: Find a potion shop there. Rob it. Get everything you can. We need the cheapest stuff possible for this ritual.
 Geralt: I can do that, I guess. 
 Geralt leaves.
 Heresy: Calling someone. Heyyyy, you know Geralt? That one guy? I KNOW, I KNOW, I'm just joking. He's actually here with me! Want to tell him? Great...
 Heresy has a knife in his hands.
 A seemingly holy glow emanates from it.

 Tsuru stretched her arms behind her back, letting a yawn slip out in the process. She lifted her glasses and rubbed her eyes. This feeling of tiredness was highly unusual, but she did not think much of it.
 A pile of papers sat on her desk. All of them contained reports of the activities she had done within the previous months. With Koranth’s first incident, the R&A tournament, the Failed incident and both the current Netheline and Dominox incidents, Tsuru had little time to tend to her deskwork.

 One day he decided to visit the tavern of a village he stated in for a few months, where he met the man who taught him common and helped treat his wounds from crossing into this realm.
 He was a sentimental fool who wanted to feel like he did then. He wears a large cloak, it did not hide who he was, simply enchanted to let folks know he’d rather they forget he was there.
 “Mr Petrikov, it is good seeing you my friend, now I must remind you I was never here.”
 ‘Of course not Hirk, you are too busy elsewhere being useless ya old drunk.’

He promised himself that he would be a better person so many days long past. Freedom came at a price, but was he doing any better outside of a jail cell? He could argue that he posed a greater danger to the world than ever before, but things were in motion that could not be changed. The Fates will act as they please.
 The doors were opened and Goatdigger saw a long line of elves on either side of the corridor. They knew who he was. Worse than elephants and dwarves with their grudges. He’d hoped the years would have dimmed their ire, but Gaia seemed to have spent the intervening time sharpening their animosity.
 Walking between the lines of elves, all manner of abuse rained down on Goatdigger. Insults of…]]></summary>
