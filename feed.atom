 They had agreed, and so the Dragon Well had been created, a massive font of power designed to replace the natural leylines that had been severed during Haven’s shift into a more defensible Demiplane. 
 The intent behind this was twofold:

 I have crossed that line long ago where mana intake is far more than my output could be if I was casting 24/7 so I want a fresh take from wizards that are still working out an answer. I find how each school of magic tends to answer this with a new perspective each generation of wizards that are born to take on the line of teaching.
