 That, in and of itself, was not a problem. He had been dead before, for much the same reasons. Picking a fight beyond his capacity, it seemed, was in danger of becoming a habit. 
 A habit he could have immediately made plans to correct if not for one simple problem: He was not where he was supposed to be. The towering gothic edifices of the Shadowfell were nowhere to be seen. 
 He stood, instead, in a long hallway carved from a black stone he could not identify. Between the arches lay murals.
