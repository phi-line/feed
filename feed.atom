        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Optimizing web performance means looking beyond surface-level metrics. Time to First Byte (TTFB) is crucial, but improving it requires more than tweaking server response time. Matt Zeunert breaks down what TTFB is, what causes its poor score, and why reducing server response time alone isn’t enough for optimization and often won’t be the most impactful change you can make to your website.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I enjoy organizing code and find cascade layers a fantastic way to organize code explicitly as the cascade looks at it.
