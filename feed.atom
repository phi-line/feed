The corruption around the eyes of people affected by it was, in essence, solidified dread, an emotion made physical, alongside a physical tether to the torment, which is where all of Dread’s strength came from. It can’t be banished spiritually, given it is physically planted, and can’t be simply ripped off, as more solidified dread would form to keep it together. though something better can be done with this.
 going through his memories, the first curse remembered something he could make, although at first he had been hesitant to make it, given he could not control it as easily, even if he was immune to the corruption it caused. But this was a worthwhile drawback

 Exhaustion and fear. That was all Chloe could feel as she ran through the maze of halls that had become her prison. She knew she was underground, and yet it felt more like being in an alternate dimension. The sound of legs clicking against the floor sent her to duck behind a stack of crates that had been left in the hall. As the clicking began to grow louder she held her breath. She had tried to escape before, so she knew how well these things could hear. All she could do now was hope it couldn’t hear her heart beating out of her chest.

 Floating islands with beautiful buildings and flora dotted the skies of the celestial realm. The realm felt at peace. In the grandest of all of these islands sat a complex of many palaces, easily the size of the largest cities in the mortal world.
 In one such palace, two children sat in the garden playing. One with golden horns and winds, and another who was wearing a cloak that hid his face in shadows. Only two blue glowing eyes were visible. They look happy. The child with horns is standing on a rock above the other child. He is holding a large stick proudly.

 Once in the place he couldn't describe well, a house or cottage, he wasn't sure. He was ordered to sweep the floor with the broom Orion tossed at him. Orbee tried catching it with manipulation but failed slightly, out of anger from 12 attempts to use it, he shifts into flesh form and geabs the broom nearly cracking it in half. Staring down at it with intense emptiness.
 Orion had been observing and when Orbee noticed, he tried to put on some confused embarrassed face despite barely understanding his own feelings or emotions other than hatred and protection.
