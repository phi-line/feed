 Cerene strode down the hallways of the capitol building, her cloak billowing behind her. Despite the last time she was here being almost a year ago, her credentials still worked, and none of the checkpoints gave her trouble as she made her way to Counselor Five’s office. 
 She was nervous, her mechanical arm twitching every couple of seconds. It did that sometimes when her heart rate was above normal. But she needed to do this. Her recent encounter with Lianna had convinced her she needed to do this. She had to face her failure. 
 Rounding a corner, she strode down the length of a long hallway to a set of large double doors. The doors to Five’s office. Cerene knew there were ECHOs hiding in the shadows nearby, but they should recognize h…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ballroom was burning. 
 Not in the traditional sense—no flames licked the velvet curtains, and no smoke choked the air—but something was undeniably wrong. The chandeliers swayed to music that wasn’t playing, shadows stretched and recoiled like dancers caught mid-step, and the guests… well, the guests had stopped moving entirely. 
 A single bony foot tapped against the marble floor, an offbeat rhythm against the silence. NecroDancer stood at the center of it all, arms outstretched, his purple robe swirling with a dramatic flair that no natural wind had caused. His silver crown tilted at an impossible angle, and the skeletal grin beneath it never wavered. 
 “Ladies and gentlemen, and everything in between!” he announced, his voice echoing with a theatrical boom. “What a dismal party this…]]></summary>

As a vengeful spirit, Tsuru did not need sleep, but it’s just one of those things she does out of preference. She rolled to her side and curled up on the futon, preparing herself for ‘slumber’. Her eyes shut and her entire world turned dark.
 The soft crunching sound of footsteps filled her ears. Trees flanked the onmyouji as she walked up the mountain road. She looked up and found that the stars shimmered in the moonlit sky. Despite the apparent calmness, none of the ambient sounds of the night could be heard. It was unnaturally quiet.
 Tsuru continued walking on the dirt path for what she felt was hours. She was quite familiar with this road, the same road she used when she was alive. It was also the same road she woul…]]></summary>

 If you know what to order you can have the barista make a potion of lichdom from all they have in those flavor pumps! The rainbow sprinkles are made from soultraped unicorns (everyone knows that's why sprinkles are not vegan)
 It boils into a soul sublimation the moment it is consumed if it is cold enough from the chill of undeath, making the souls fuse with my necrotic aura in necromantic vortex with a sweet coffee sent that keeps me perked up all day.

 Sloop at half sail, 6 other mechanical spiders scurry about the deck, working on minimizing crosswind. While the ship gets moving, steam emanates upward from the sea floor, most of it ending up underneath the boat, leaving some small whiffs on the edges, though no mind is paid to this as the inorganic members of this vessel observe the horizon in order to chart headwinds and tides.
 After a few hours, when the boat has long since gotten out of any wards, and is now in the sea, 6 of the spiders are suddenly hit by lightning. But, oddly enough,…]]></summary>

 I as a totally responsible adult I sold them the first tome I saw.....few hours later I saw the consequences of my actions....I basically gave em a tome of gunmancy.....how I knew this? 
 BECUASE ALL THEY WERE SAYING WERE THOSE STUPID PHRASES LIKE 
 "I cast volley of lead"
 "I may run out of spells but not out of shells"
 "I cast Gun"
 Or 
 "I said I was out of mana not options"
 Some time later and lots of times I almost get shot.. I managed to retrieve the tome back and wipe their minds before they snitched on my humble ass to the R&A for selling those types of magical to apprentices...
 God.......Saradonim was kinda right in some points
 Apprentices are stupid...
