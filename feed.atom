 Everyday is to perform divine messanger duties after waking up so could have some time off on end of the day to work hard to improve myself as a divine messanger kitsune, after day of hard work deservers a bath in the onsen in land of kitsunes near the head temple of divine messangers.
 Sometimes duties are small, so I have more time for myself, hence I go visit a shrine I am guarding from evil spirits and protect those vulnerable from such spirits and assist them with their everyday work. Its not as easy as it looks to be divine messanger, but I chose this path as great kitsune, Oka, my master, took me under her wing and with her encouragement passed divine messanger exam and thus I've been divine messanger for 1900 years.
 I do not regret a thing as what I have dedicated myself to do, to help others and defend the weak.
 It is not easy to be a divine messanger.

Like today this morning we were greeted with a big bright orb of flame, but never can we see the sun set, it just leaves in the mist of the humidity, yet, here we were all, sitting in the blue wet grass and looking at the horizon, it was a faint light, barely noticeable and easy to walk by the rare sight.
  
 “So that’s what a sunset looks like?” Liam asked with his head up trying to see more of the light.
  
 “I’ve seen it once, it’s beautiful, red orange pink and purples.” Ari says with a slight smile on her little face. 
  
 I myself wasn’t able to see it now, it was disappointing, and Liam was even more disappointed.…]]></summary>

 Rin sat on a small bench, speaking into a microphone with all the energy of a nighttime downpour. Just opposite her was an automa casted in steel and gold that had been spray painted with some of her own designs. Small swirls and spirals, alongside simple patterns that had been stenciled on breathed colour and creativity to a previously serious creation. Seeing her disposition, the bot gave a thumbs up. It didn't help but it pushed her on enough.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atriox was disgruntled. He hadn’t had a good idea in a while. So he stretched and decided to visit his hoard, something that rarely happened these days. He hadn’t long lost his lust for gold and silver and other precious metals due to his being an earth dragon that could simply call the metals out of the earth on a whim. Still he kept it around for sentimental reasons.
 As the colossal dragon strode through the cavern his eyes paused on one of the more odd and disdainful pieces in his hoard, an Orb of Dragonkind. The orb was a weapon that wizards had crafted to trap and kill his kind. It made him snarl in rage at the thought and swept past. How would those upstart mages like it if they were… if they were…
 Atriox’s fangs bared themselves in a malicious grin.
 Thre Days Later
 An orb puts out a call. It has all the answers to the questions that wizards have asked for millennia as well as answers to questions that were never thought to be asked. For a thousand miles in every direction magic users feel the orb’s wisdom and secrets whispering to them. And they feel compelled to come to the peak of the mountain where it rests.
 Far below Atriox grins in wait, ready to trigger the ancient volcano that had been dormant for hundreds of thousands of years. he just had to wait a little while longer for the Orb of Wizardkind to do its job of luring them in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reconstruct Writings is a restorative spell that returns a piece of text to its original state. This includes what it was written on and what it was written in. The spell will attempt to bring together the original materials but if they are destroyed or too far apart it will replace them with magical matter at a higher mana cost. The amount of damage and the age of said damage change the effectiveness of this spell. The more damaged and the older said damage negatively affects the spells effectiveness. Resulting in progressively less legible results. 
 It's a minor spell, capable of being easily cast by most apprentices to repair paper but its usefulness is not to be understated. Any mage in a profession interacting with text should learn it. I can't tell you the amount of books I've been able to save from the consequences of a misfortunate or reckless situation with this spell alone. It has also served me greatly in archival purposes keeping decade old books and manuscripts in top condition. It's great at fixing important documents if you just so happen to spill tea over them as well
 Like many spells we take for granted despite its simple casting the inner workings of the spell are surprisingly complex, built upon many hundreds of years of magical developments. If you were to break it down, the spell requires minor oracling to identify the original components and their construction, tracking magic to find the component in the present, telekinetic magic to bring them together, transmutational magic to form It back to its original state, and finally conjuration magic to fill in any potential gaps. All of that and more has been wrapped up into an easily castable spell. So simple even a novice can use it. Every spell truly is a wonder if you only look a little deeper.
