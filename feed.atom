 /rw/ With a certain dragon on the loose again, and not many people taking his offer of superweapon dealings, Ace decided he'd test a weapon to counter the goliath- even though he knew he couldn't start any fights without Koranth's explicit permission, he knew he could finish them. So he unveiled it on an empty ice sheet. It was a massive Cosmo Cannon, which, like the rest, functioned by creating a portal near the targrt and in the barrel, then firing into the portal.
