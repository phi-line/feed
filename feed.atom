        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Image Source: Jurassic Park)
 The presence of mega-flora was a new experience for Kardonk, not to mention the existence of mega-fauna. He spend several days trying to decide if he should venture from the beach and risk it in the jungle’s muggy terrain. In the end, a need for fresh water drove him into the greenery.
 The Paleomancer, it seems, had taken some ill-advised shining to Hazema. This Kardonk knew, but believed the amicability between the two of them, plus the promise to attempt to free the Paleomancer from Hellfire had been enough to smooth over that difference, at least until the day that Kardonk chose to again seek conflict with the Tyrant of Drakeem.
 He had been mistaken. After an attempt to get Kardonk to foreswear any violence against Hazema, and Kardonk’s refusal to swear to such a thing provided she continued to terrorize the surrounding nations, The Paleomancer managed to trick him to and island 80 million years in the past under the guise of discussing his contract in a place where Hellfire could not possibly overhear. 
 Now, without a way home, Kardonk was forced to hunt for his survival. The first thing he learned was that it took a terrifying number of bullets to take down a Tyrannosaur. The second thing he learned was that he had no way to keep the meat, at least not as it stood. The vast majority of the carcass was devoured by carrion or spoiled within a manner of days.
 He determined quickly that he needed a fire. This was not overly difficult between the collection of fallen limbs and the sacrifice of some of his now precious gunpowder. The difficult part was learning enough of the science of fire making to keep the flame burning perpetually, in rain or in heat.
 Soon he had a large blaze going on the beach, shielded by a stone and wood structure from the wind and rain. Phase one of the plan was complete.
 Now he just needed to wrangle a Deinonychus.

A tinge of anger flashed across Valmnos' soul, but he hid it well from his co-conspirators, "You could not best a single Guardian, let alone the group they would send once becoming aware of your presence.

 The Maggot Host marches through a wide valley in the southern border region between the Kingdom of Rando and the Republic of Knowhere. The Nurglite warriors’ footfalls can be heard for miles up and down the valley, and the reek of decaying flesh carries even further on the wind. Tamurkhan rides at the head of the enormous horde atop the toad dragon Bubebolos, followed by his lieutenants and elite warriors from each of his Infector Cohorts. Without warning, he raises his fist, signaling for the march to halt. Warband leaders copy the gesture all the way down the line, despite their confusion. Why has Tamurkhan chosen to stop here?

 The Void stretches infinitely, its silence suffocating. Null stands at its center—a shifting absence, darker than darkness, embodying the emptiness he seeks to reclaim for all existence. Before him, a figure emerges—not from the void, but as though they had always been present, their form defined by an aura of crushing weight as their very essence bends the void to their will... and this is but a projection...
 "You summoned me, Null," the figure intones, their voice a grinding pressure that echoes without sound.
 Null’s form quivers slightly under the oppressive force, but his resolve remains unshaken. He inclines toward them, as much an act of submission as one of purpose. "There is something I must show you."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Arcane source is perhaps the most intimate and personal of the four sources, as it originates from within. It is the wellspring of magic that resides in the soul, heart, or essence of the practitioner. Arcane magic represents raw, unfiltered power brought forth through discipline, willpower, and mastery over oneself.
 Let us begin.
 The Core of Arcane Magic: The Inner Spark
 At the heart of the Arcane lies the spark, a fragment of potential unique to every being capable of wielding it. This spark is the connection to the latent power within. While it is universally present, its strength varies widely among individuals. Some are born with a roaring inferno, others with a faint ember, but mastery depends not on the size of the spark, but on how it is nurtured and controlled.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Megacity of Den Ulock had fallen to the cult of Dominox. The Sect of Creation had been busy. Doing as their leader instructed, converting everyone they could, slaughtering everyone they couldn't. Most people joined of course, an army of cultists creating matter from nothing tend to be quite convincing. As the city fell, temples had been constructed at equal points around the city. Every single one was pointed towards Dominox's tree at the north edge.
 *In every single temple people had seen the Fanatical Leader sacrificing non-believers, muttering something to himself each time. No one had ever once seen him leave the temples, no one had ever seen him rest, no one had ever seen him eat. No one had ever seen him without his mask, naturally rumours began. Some said he had no face, some said he had been scarred heavily in a duel with a false god, some were stranger, saying he had the face of Dominox. When the Leader heard of the last one he gave a seven hour talk on how and why no one was worthy to have the face of Dominox.
 Debn Unlock had been changing, systems altered to suit the cults ideals. Shortly after the cults arrival the mayor had fled to find help, neither believing in Dominox nor wishing to be killed. Nine hours later news spread of her capture. She was due to be sacrificed today. However very few knew which of the seven temples she would be executed in.
 Travel in and out had been monitored, the Godless sinners could be anywhere afterall. Having nothing better to do than tear down everything the great Dominox stood for.
