        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If one didn't know Drakeem and Ithacar were allied the following scene would look very much like an all out invasion. The sky outside the city is filled with Drakeem forces, recent revolutions in mana stone technology used to project the Empires symbol on its Airfleet.
 Light aircraft keep landing people outside of Ithacar. Their origin is the Drakeem Airforce hovering in the sky. The presence of these Zepplins and Airships calls for some questions about the kinds of allies Ithacar is keeping company.
 The dropships only stop arriving after a decently sized group has been landed. In the middle of it all is Hazema, Empress of Drakeem, aswell as some of her court. The rest of this diplomatic envoy is made up out of bodyguards, or rather soldiers. They form a protective barrier around the Drakeem royalty as they make their way to the city gates.
 Some of the landed soldiers don't have horns, which is unusual as Drakeems soldiers are almost exclusively clones. These odd bunch are heading to the embassy instead of staying with the royal posse.
 /uw second image is about what the zeppelins look like, first is because I ran out of drawings a long time ago 😭

This would not normally be a notable occurrence but in this case the soul of being that it consisted of caught some attention once a devil of higher rank stumbled across it. A phone call was made to one of Johnbots of the CEO of Hell. After a long conversation and a verification of the identity of the soul a deal was reached.
 A ritual was performed, the lemure was given a modest amount of power and what emerged was a lemure no longer but a Rakshasa of modest power. With a growl it flexed its new form and examined the documents provided by the imp. A copy of the contract and an ID.
 Kalim Tigerius Urthus, newly commisioned jeweler and merchant of the Nine Hells. A most appropriate profession for him. He even knew where there was a lovely stash of jewels was located to get him started. Kalim took a hard step, his leg buckled a Dan he frowned. Right. He couldn’t do that anymore. New stage of existence, new powers. That would take some getting used to.
 Kalim took a moment to close his eyes and focus. Then with a pop he plane shifted to his target destination. A massive cavern filled with beautiful and artistically grown gems of all colors and varieties. Kalim knelt down before one and lifted the perfectly grown sapphire to admire it. Perhaps one day the ability to grow such beauty would be his once more. For now he would have to settle with admiring and sadly, selling them.
 Kalim gathered a number more of them, retrieved a few trinkets and weapons, then shifted to another location. There was work to do and deal to keep. Even in life, Kalim had been a soul of his word, he wasn’t going to break that now. It would be a difficult task but he would have to figure it out.

He was lying in some sort of glass vat, the fluid that once filled it now only sticking to the sides of the container and his own body. A quieter, more comforting sound filled his ears, drowning everything else out. It took him a while to understand the jumble of words being said to him, eventually managing deciphering them.
 “The miracle of a new life is such a beautiful thing. Wouldn’t you agree?”
 He managed to muster up enough complex thought to give a response, though it felt foreign on his lips and was barely above a whisper.

 Oh Haven rejoice. Cast off your cloaks of mourning and wash the ashes from your heads, for our Lord has returned to us. 
 You may recall how our Lord Siliske was slain by Vulkan the Foul. Hear now the true telling of this act. For his death was not tragedy but a cunning plan to bait the old blind serpent with the promise of slaughter and lure him away from his people, lest we perish beneath his claws. 
 To us, his most faithful servants, he entrusted his heart, that he might be called back when the time was right. His fate ensured, he allowed the vile Wyrm to slay him, putting up only what resistance was necessary to complete the deception.
