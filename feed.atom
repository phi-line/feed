 Exia: Considering our imminent loss in the EON Chancellor elections against Ten Suns of the Bismuth Realms, we have decided to already announce the one thing we were going to do regardless of the election's outcome. The Celestial Union is reviving the Laterano World's Fair.
 Kennedy: A quick history lesson. The World's Fair was first held in the Custodian Empire's capital, Citta Custodia, in 343 b.F. It was a scientific and cultural convention where the different nations of Laterano, at the time the Custodian Empire, the Verdant Realm of Kiria, the Xinan Kham and the Higashi Shogunate, convened and showed off their newest developments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was a particularly cold night even for Koranth's realm. The winds sung a howling song as they whipped around the streets and buildings. It was a beautiful sight for those who didn't care about the cold. One such group was rapidly approaching in a Bismuth Eye. The giant metal machine flew through the howling winds with little issue. Neither it nor it's cargo cared for the beautiful scene or the bitter wind. They were sent with a purpose.
 The Bismuth eye floated outside of official airspace until flight control gave them a location to land. The Bismuth Eye gently landed, balancing on its multiple landing struts. It disgorged its contents onto the landing pad. One Bismuth Coordinator guarded by two prismatic knights and accompanied by drones carrying equipment for the experiments. 
 "We have come to begin experimentation. Please direct us."
 The Bismuth were always straight to the point. They followed their appointed minder to a specially prepared lab set up by Koranth's people. It was proportioned for larger individuals given the size of the coordinator and was segmented away from one of the main buildings in case any of the experiments went up in a massive explosion. Not likely but given the nature of magic not impossible either. 
 They began setting up their equipment while they waited for the Queen to come begin the experiments. They had transmutation forges, virtual recreations of the prismatic gem to perform virtual experiments, a collection of 36 other magical gemstones to compare structure and resonance, And a very impressive analytic device to sift through all the data. 
 Once they were finished setting up they sent a message to Koranth telling them they were ready.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kalim huffed in pure annoyance. He needed to recharge the Rod of Resurrection he purchased from Vulkan. To do that he needed Titan’s blood. Ten Suns would trade his Titan’s blood for Leviathan tears. Unfortunately, Kalim didn’t have those but another person had them. Unfortunately that person wanted a bicorn horn. To get the bicorn horn though Kalim would need rainbow pearls. Unfortunately the person with the rainbow pearls wanted the power of Gaia…
 Kalim was quite irritated by the busywork of a CHAINED FETCH QUEST. Seriously he was a fiend from the Nine Hells and not even he was that sadistic. He would track down whatever soul invented the idea of the chained fetch quest and make sure that soul ceased to exist. They were probably already in the Nine Hells for their sadism anyways.
 Kalim stalked along and then paused. Wait a minute… KALIM KNEW A TITAN ALREADY! With tears of joy the Rakshasa flew off to find Atlas and asking for a drop of blood, leaving the Chained Fetch Quest from beyond Hell behind. An hour later he had the blood, which he traded for with Atlas the Titan in exchange for the last bottle of 774 Lemarcia red wine. Expensive? Yes, but so worth it to skip the stupid, stupid, stupid CHAINED FETCH QUEST. Now he just had to find the extixnct race of gem folk that was the target of his Rod of Resurrection.
 Oh and find a specific soul to rend apart.
