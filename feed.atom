Strange, he knew exactly how he got there, yet he still couldn't quite figure out how his day went this way. He righted himself, then flew out the hole, he found a dragon twice the size of a horse staring at him.
 'Are you okay?'
 "Yeah, I'm fine. You did well, very well."
 'Really?'
 "Yeah, that's what your sixth try? That was impressive, even more so for your age. Let's go home."
 The two flew back to Freetown, Alaric thought about how he'd gotten into this situation.
 Earlier that day he was hovering a few hundred meters away from one of Dominox's trees. The tree was still there. Still hadn't done anything. He was still in the sky. This, was a waste of time. If the damn thing was going to do something it would h…]]></summary>

 This wasn’t really about diplomacy. Not entirely. Too much had been left unsaid—not just from their last confrontation, but since the day they first met: Bottled-up words, unspoken observations. The wizard could only hope his invitee would honor the request to come alone. Of course, there would be others watching from the shadows, but that was fine. The Paleomancer had nothing to say to them. His words were for the Praetor alone.
 The three-day wait had ended. Atollon stood silent, waiting. No roaring theropods, no bellowing sauropods, no flittering pterosaurs or breaching mosasaurs. The creatures had withdrawn to the island’s depths, leaving the coast eerily barren. Only the wind moved now, weaving through ancient vegetation.
 All that was left was to wait for his arrival.

 “Ugh…”
 “A-are you ok?”
 Jay looks over the old man on the ground, worry in his eyes.
 “Yes I’m fine. Only a few bruises. This is a fine mess we’re in.” Thomas sits up. “I dont think going back to the farm is a safe idea anymore…Shadeholme wants your head on a stick, and worst of all I don’t have the foggiest idea of where we are right now.”
 As he says that, Jay realizes that he doesn’t recognize where he is. He looks around only to see that he’s now on a beach with…]]></summary>
