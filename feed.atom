 "Welcome my citizens! I have recently reached the conclusion that a theocratic monarchy is problematic as it puts most people down. A truly perfect society is one where the weakest can thrive. This is the reason why Drakeem will from now on be a social-democracy!"
 "Instead of mass producing soldiers our clone plants will instead pump out doctors, farmers and social workers! Education will become a big focus instead of war or trade. Trade will be abolished entirely due to the inherently corrupt nature of the capitalistic system and we will work hard to help the workers revolution in other nations around the world."
 "Furthermore we will enforce a 4 day workweek and expand unionization. The first election will be held in half a year. During that time the legislature will work on the constitution and me and my colleagues will work hard to make sure the transfer of power is swift and peaceful. Last but not least we will sign the international treaty forbidding the use of certain magic's especially during wartime."
 "That is all!"
 The first president of Drakeem leaves the stage under thunderous applause as the former empire turns over a new leaf
 /uw Happy April 1st! This is obviously not real lore, sorry!

His left foot was pressed against the wall as his head faced the ground. The shadow cast from his hat obscured his eyes, but what one could see from his poker face was that he seemed unnaturally calm.
 A small group stared fearfully at the locked door as if some monster was going to burst through at any moment. This group was composed of one newly elected councillor and a few of her aides. Another individual sat next to the terrified group, but it was hard to tell anything about them. Other than that, they were a female with an intimidating aura. From under her cloak, she glared at them dismissively. The previous generations of councillors, to her option, weren’t such weaklings to crawl into an aband…]]></summary>

She knew she was underground, and yet it felt more like being in an alternate dimension. The sound of legs clicking against the floor sent her to duck behind a stack of crates that had been left in the hall. As the clicking began to grow louder she held her breath. She had tried to escape before, so she knew how well these things could hear. All she could do now was hope it couldn’t hear her heart beating out of her chest.
 Her stomach dropped as the sound stopped immediately in front of her. She knew she should at least try to make a run for it as she heard the thing move toward the stack of crates. But her own fear paralyzed h…]]></summary>
