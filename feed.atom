 the weapon was a schyte made of pitch black metal with a gravitational pull to it self
 Sea swung the schyte and did a few cool tricks with it before entering the cave, he knew what was in there, he knew how much stronger it was then him, yet he didn't care for if he would die or not, he just wanted to have some fun
 the inside of the cave was filled with beautiful crystals and weird motifs of someone fighting a dragon and sealing it waya in a cave using the body of a different dragon
 Sea already knew these tho and knew that he didn't have much time until the rotting dragon could escape it's confinement

The day was perfectly calm until this strange person entered the tavern, covered in pale dust and in scandalous purple robes. This drunkard - I didn't know him personally but I've heard he be called 'Sbeve', something along those lines - he made the mistake of confronting this lunatic magician. He was all in his face, hurling insults, "you look like a moldy blueberry!" I remember was one of them. The mage didn't seem to notice him at first until... Brush This guy had just rested his arm on the man's shoulder, wiping away the dust on his skin. This was when the magician snapped, his face screwed like someone had just used power word: crunch. It didn't take long until there was an orange flash, and before me was no longer the drunkard but now a round, crispy, inch long chicken nugget.

 The inhabitants did what they wanted to do when they wanted to do it. The abilities of the people varied, but one thing remained constant. In order to survive, you needed to fly.

 As he speaks, he begins drawing diagrams on a chalkboard, four circles, overlapping.
 "Magic is not merely a tool, nor a force to be wielded recklessly. It is the breath of existence itself, a symphony that hums within and beyond all things. To understand magic is to understand the very fabric of reality."
 He begins writing in the circles.

Still, it could've cut her arms off and she'd still say that it was..

 The Kingdom of Rando and the Republic of Knowhere had been fighting for weeks. Now their armies were engaged in fierce fighting in the hilly mountain region on their borders. While many of their mages were gone due to the previous attacks their more traditional forces were fighting in the narrow passes of the region and both sides were supplied with weapons from Shadeholme.
 In the middle of these clashes they felt a shift in the earth. Then a series of massive tunnels opened up at strategic points and the armies of Earth’s Embrace poured onto the surface.
