        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Orion was shocked at Atriox's appearance since everyone had him for dead. He had to do something to protect the empire of boom and it had to be done fast. He studied ancient books and scrolls... At the local library. 
 Of course that didn't get him far but he learnt the spell summon stone elemental. Although because of his age it wasn't really powerful he saw potential in it. He spent a whole week casting it every evening and had managed to create an army of 10.000.000.
 It was a small but needed step to survive Atriox's inevitable attack.

 Weight: Indeterminate; fluctuates due to their shifting forms 
 Description: 
 The entities known as Fishermen are among the most disturbing of the Black Lake’s inhabitants, not for their sheer size or strength, but for their eerie mimicry of human behavior. Lurking just beneath the water’s surface, they resemble grotesque, elongated figures draped in what appears to be rotting oilskin and netting. Their faces are obscured by barnacle-encrusted masks—once resembling the carved visages of old fishermen, but now warped beyond recognition. Beneath these masks, no discernible facial features have been found, only endless black v…]]></summary>

 The devil at the customs check seemed intent on snapping Belial out of his train of thought. Timed perfectly to be at the most annoying point possible.
 "Keep yer fuckin' shirt on. I'm a veteran y'know."
 Belial snarled at the ruddy imp with pointed teeth. The custom checker would not realize who he was speaking to of course. Lightbent illusion made the him appear as a simple horned devil. A lost survivor of Bel's failed incursion into the material plane. The EON visa looted from the pocket of said horned devil reinforced this apparent truth.
