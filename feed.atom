 One in particular came to mind.
 They couldn’t name them, they never had one given to them, nor did they make one for themself. If an archaeologist were to examine all impacts they made during life, the historian would conclude they never existed. But they did.
 It was something even Amanoth felt pity for, having no impact in the present and no legacy to the future.

The ancient Nurglite champion Tamurkhan has arisen in the far south, rallying the malevolent Vashar civilization to his banner with promises of deicide and revenge against magekind. The Maggot Lord plans to conquer the magical world as an offering to the Plaguelord so that he can at last ascend as a daemon prince and claim the legendary Throne of Chaos. Yet hope endures, for a Vasharan defector named Ashurhaddon Ka’al has brought us vital information concerning Tamurkhan’s warhost. Combined with our own auguries, we have managed to get a rough idea of the doctrine and organization of his forces well ahead of his planned invasion.
 As the Maggot Host’s ranks swell with Chaos-marked warriors from the Vasharan realms and beyond, Tamurkhan knows he…]]></summary>
