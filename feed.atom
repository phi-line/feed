 By that, I mean are dragons more like fish, or like crabs. Since there is not really a close connection to many creatures we call dragons, like wyverns, jabberwocks, hydras, giant snails, snake like wyrms or even true dragons, either the western or eastern variety, which are more closely related. All of those creatures are called dragons, and it's mostly due to they're similar features, or so many people think, since what are those similar features actually.

It represents the ultimate blend of internal mastery, external natural forces, mortal ingenuity, and divine will.

This is the realm of Universalism, the rare and awe-inspiring practice that channels the totality of existence into raw power. Let’s delve into its intricacies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time of year to collect cuttings may vary depending on the location and type of grapevine. 
 By using cuttings, growers can make sure that the plants they are growing will make the same quality of grapes. If they were to let the plants reproduce from seed then the resulting plant would be a mix of two different grapevines (we’re going to ignore perfect plants and self pollination for the sake of simplicity) meaning the resulting grapes could be drastically different. 
 Not all plants can be grown from cuttings, if you’re planning to grow your own make sure to do some research!

 The one cure being to find the closest jar of mayonnaise, and to eat all of the contents of the mayonnaise jar in one sitting.
 If there is no mayonnaise available to you, after 1 hour the curse becomes permanent.
