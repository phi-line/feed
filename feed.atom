They… somewhat resembled the late Professor Friezen. Vanio blinked and he could quickly see it was just a stranger, no one he knew. Though disturbed, he continued walking on. Merely 5 steps later, he had to pause and check if he had heard her voice. Vanio quickened his pace.

 In the light of the moon lay a magic mass and a note. One sunny morning the mass read it: a quote! 
 “What does it mean to dream?”
 The note pried.
 “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA”
 The mass replied. And pop! Where the note had been appeared a large and very tasty book.
 The mass saw the book and immediately thought “FOOD!”. So, he left a cheese wheel beneath it and through the pages he chewed.
 But he was still hungry.

It took him a while to find such a spot, but shortly thereafter, he set the place up with cameras and printers, and posters started going out. They read "Hey, Cultists! Want to prove your god is as good as you say? Then FIGHT ME. If your god's will can't take out one of my bodies, then is he even a god?! Come to [insert address here], and take me on! I'm not in short supply of these bodies!", and have a picture of the building and of Ace. From there, he waits for a challenger.
 /uw/ Pic unrelated. This post is mostly meant for anyone playing Dominox or his cultists, but I'd welcome a duel with any other cultists or cult leaders.
