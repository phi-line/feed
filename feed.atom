 Tsuru stretched her arms behind her back, letting a yawn slip out in the process. She lifted her glasses and rubbed her eyes. This feeling of tiredness was highly unusual, but she did not think much of it.
 A pile of papers sat on her desk. All of them contained reports of the activities she had done within the previous months. With Koranth’s first incident, the R&A tournament, the Failed incident and both the current Netheline and Dominox incidents, Tsuru had little time to tend to her deskwork.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hirk had found himself wandering, wasn’t head of R&A and never joined R&A so was not a worker, at this point technically a poor bum, but he still had his ways of having just enough.
 One day he decided to visit the tavern of a village he stated in for a few months, where he met the man who taught him common and helped treat his wounds from crossing into this realm.
 He was a sentimental fool who wanted to feel like he did then. He wears a large cloak, it did not hide who he was, simply enchanted to let folks know he’d rather they forget he was there.
 “Mr Petrikov, it is good seeing you my friend, now I must remind you I was never here.”
 ‘Of course not Hirk, you are too busy elsewhere being useless ya old drunk.’
 “I haven’t drank in a while, been clean for a few months. But I think it’s …]]></summary>

He promised himself that he would be a better person so many days long past. Freedom came at a price, but was he doing any better outside of a jail cell? He could argue that he posed a greater danger to the world than ever before, but things were in motion that could not be changed. The Fates will act as they please.
 The doors were opened and Goatdigger saw a long line of elves on either side of the corridor. They knew who he was. Worse than elephants and dwarves with their grudges. He’d hoped the years would have dimmed their ire, but Gaia seemed to have spent the intervening time sharpening their animosity.
 Walking between the lines of elves, all manner of abuse rained down on Goatdigger. Insults of…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After completing my morokov chain planar enchantment on my tower to allow for working multiple plans at once, my gargoyle sentries started to malfunction.
 Of the eight I had stationed on my tower five have disappeared, and the other three are inoperable. I knew that they wouldn't last long (they were a bulk purchase from BJ max) but I thought they would have some durability to acausal fluctuations.
 If anyone can help me find those five gargoyles I can re-enchant them to Improve their performance. I will offer items from my curio collection to any helping hands. Each gargoyle has my insignia etched into their forehead. A cube slowly rotating on a 2D plane. If the image isn't moving it isn't my gargoyle.
 A reminder that they could be in any dimension now, so keep your orbs scrying.
