 Reality is as a patchwork, dear reader. Realms hang connected, suspended over nothing, or rather the Beneath.
 To say the Beneath is nothing is to understate. There are things in the Beneath, even living things, though most suffer in it. The Beneath is below reality, and is not quite real. It is from the time before, like all such things, and defies description. Some scholars of the Drukkenmet postulate the Beneath itself is alive, like a serpent at the heart of all things, -This is false- coiled in the depths.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I toss the unassuming yellow orb at full strength, and it sails off into the distance as I duck down into the foxhole then hastily cover the opening with a conjured wall of force. After what seems like minutes of anticipation, but is only mere seconds, the tetrated spark grenade detonates.
 Even from within cover, the shockwave hits me hard, yet I don't hear the sound of an explosion. The ground trembles violently and for a moment I fear my foxhole might collapse. Large stones and rubble are flung far and wide, continuing to rain down for several seconds as a rising ring fills my ears. I drop the wall of force covering my foxhole, then peek out to survey the devastation.
 I am not disappointed. I'm greeted by a prodigious crater, about 30 meters or more across and nearly 10 meters deep. The land has been scorched far and wide, to a radius of almost 200 meters, back to my foxhole and beyond.
 "Look at this! It's magnificent!" I yell out to my Simulacrum, though my voice sounds distant and barely audible. I yell out loudly "The farmer has his pond now, just like that!" though I still barely hear myself over my ringing ears.
 Expecting a reply from my Simulacrum I turn around to see a pile of melting snow where it once stood. I smile at the loss of my conjured companion, because this shows the kill radius is at least around a hundred fifty meters, and it was always a mere pseudo-sentient construct after all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Creation
 You sleep, surrounded by unceasing hurt,
 by hardship and loss,
 by pain and suffering,
 by fear and helplessness.
 Memories suppressed into dreams,
 dreams forgotten in the seas of emotion.
 Endless growth between every breath.
 Pain begets pain begets pain begets pain.
 Your screams express your divine suffering,
 until they subsumed into the pandemonium.
 To be is to be in pain,
 to live is to suffer,
 to suffer is to live.
 All you are is pain,
 without pain you are not.
 A fate worse than a fate worse than death.
 Existence condenses,
 the pressure builds.
 There is not enough room for you anymore,
 not among all else that is.
 The cacophony encloses you.
 You are pressed, surrounded, squeezed,
 between the growing mass of all that is,
 and the invading expanse of all that is not.
 You try to hold on to the pain.
 You try to hold on to the suffering.
 Your hold slips,
 your pain ends,
 your suffering ends,
 you end.
 What was once you wakes for the first time,
 you are nothing for the nth time.
 “The miracle of a new life is such a beautiful thing. Wouldn’t you agree?”

 /rw/ With a certain dragon on the loose again, and not many people taking his offer of superweapon dealings, Ace decided he'd test a weapon to counter the goliath- even though he knew he couldn't start any fights without Koranth's explicit permission, he knew he could finish them. So he unveiled it on an empty ice sheet. It was a massive Cosmo Cannon, which, like the rest, functioned by creating a portal near the targrt and in the barrel, then firing into the portal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This test releases a formidable explosion, though as my Simulacrum quickly points out "It's about the scale of the first unamplified fireball test."
 I groan in open frustration, then say "So we're back where we started. We either have to increase the base energy, or use a higher class of amplification."
 After pondering for a moment I muse aloud, saying "I don't dare even square the fireball. We want to leave our host's home standing after all..." I stroke my beard thoughtfully and continue, "so the only thing to do is move on to tetration."
 I create yet another lasting spark, though it is almost effortless compared to the fireball. This time I create a yellow plane of force and bubble it through twice.
 The golden two layered shield wrapped around an unending spark fits perfectly in my hand, about the size of a plum. It could take days to charge, but after a half dozen casts of my Time Acceleration spell it begins to warm. Now inside the innermost layer it shows a churning cloud, glowing with barely restrained power.
 I take a few minutes to rest, then prepare for the next test. "Spark tetrated to two! Get ready!" I pause to give my Simulacrum a chance to cast a few more blast wards, then yell "Fire in the hole!"
