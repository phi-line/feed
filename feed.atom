        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bur Oaks are drought and fire resistant due to their long tap roots and thick bark! The trees can live for hundreds of years and only start producing acorns around 35 years old. The acorns are edible and have been used as a food source for as long as people have been in the americas. 
 I didn’t have room for it, but I personally think the Bur Oak has some of the most beautiful leaves, flowers, and bark of any oak tree (you should google it it’s really pretty, you can see some pics on the Morton Arboretum site here) 
 /uw are you in the Chicago area and want to check out some beautiful trees in person? Try the Morton Arboretum or consider donating today! They’ve got science and art exhibits, a maze garden, and social events pretty much every week!

 Waddel: I DON'T KNOW, EITHER!

 Geralt: Why?
 Heresy: There's something I need to do before I leave you alone.
 Geralt: ...You mean me and the rest of Fluffco?

 Eukarya’s night sky is a beautiful sight that is inescapable. Once Shadeholme conquered the colony under Sylvane, a smaller Well of Shadows was constructed on a metal platform in the middle of the Silver Bay. It was that day Sylvane declared the Shadeholme confederation into the Ce’Darian Empire, and ever since that day the Well there has remained active.
 This is the first time she will see it. Rose had scheduled a visit to the Well under “a duty of the office…]]></summary>

But then you'd give it a second look and start to notice things. Things like the religious monument in the exact center of the city, or the 30 dragon children walking around, or the celestial god building houses for peasants. But despite the circumstances, it is quite a nice place to live, even with Dominox establishing a rip off Erdtree in the lake. It wasn't the perfect place to live, but it was a good enough place for reality altering draconic children to grow up.
 One such child, Kriiddorahjun had aged surprisingly fast compared to his siblings. Where the others were nearing the age of toddlers, or five year olds, he was approaching eight years old. Shock…]]></summary>
