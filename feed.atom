        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Image Source: Jurassic Park)
 The presence of mega-flora was a new experience for Kardonk, not to mention the existence of mega-fauna. He spend several days trying to decide if he should venture from the beach and risk it in the jungle’s muggy terrain. In the end, a need for fresh water drove him into the greenery.
 The Paleomancer, it seems, had taken some ill-advised shining to Hazema. This Kardonk knew, but believed the amicability between the two of them, plus the promise to attempt to free the Paleomancer from Hellfire had been enough to smooth over that difference, at least until the day that Kardonk chose to again seek conflict with the Tyrant of Drakeem.
 He had been mistaken. After an attempt to get Kardonk to foreswear any violence against Hazema, and Kardonk’s refusal to swear to such a thing provided she continued to terrorize the surrounding nations, The Paleomancer managed to trick him to and island 80 million years in the past under the guise of discussing his contract in a place where Hellfire could not possibly overhear. 
 Now, without a way home, Kardonk was forced to hunt for his survival. The first thing he learned was that it took a terrifying number of bullets to take down a Tyrannosaur. The second thing he learned was that he had no way to keep the meat, at least not as it stood. The vast majority of the carcass was devoured by carrion or spoiled within a manner of days.
 He determined quickly that he needed a fire. This was not overly difficult between the collection of fallen limbs and the sacrifice of some of his now precious gunpowder. The difficult part was learning enough of the science of fire making to keep the flame burning perpetually, in rain or in heat.
 Soon he had a large blaze going on the beach, shielded by a stone and wood structure from the wind and rain. Phase one of the plan was complete.
 Now he just needed to wrangle a Deinonychus.

 The Maggot Host marches through a wide valley in the southern border region between the Kingdom of Rando and the Republic of Knowhere. The Nurglite warriors’ footfalls can be heard for miles up and down the valley, and the reek of decaying flesh carries even further on the wind. Tamurkhan rides at the head of the enormous horde atop the toad dragon Bubebolos, followed by his lieutenants and elite warriors from each of his Infector Cohorts. Without warning, he raises his fist, signaling for the march to halt. Warband leaders copy the gesture all the way down the line, despite their confusion. Why has Tamurkhan chosen to stop here?
 When the cacophonous sound of steel-shod boots pounding against the earth dies away, the Maggot Lord and his mount tur…]]></summary>

 The Void stretches infinitely, its silence suffocating. Null stands at its center—a shifting absence, darker than darkness, embodying the emptiness he seeks to reclaim for all existence. Before him, a figure emerges—not from the void, but as though they had always been present, their form defined by an aura of crushing weight as their very essence bends the void to their will... and this is but a projection...
 "You summoned me, Null," the figure intones, their voice a grinding pressure that echoes without sound.
 Null’s form quivers slightly under the oppressive force, but his resolve remains unshaken. He inclines toward them, as much an act of submission as one of purpose. "There is something I must show you."

 Ten billion, of the fourty billion humans that have died without a sanctified burial, or that are not in hell have been cleared with passports to the living world. 
 They will be offered citizenship to my lands for surface in my army, but those that dont take the offer are free to walk the earth. Updates to translation spells are being put into place to make to ease communication with the dead languages they speak. 
 I have givin them a small amount of gold to pay thier way u till they get on thier feet, but its largly up to them to find a way to pay for a propper burial once they inevitably are bored of the mortal world and want to rest once more in an appropriate here after. 
 The limbo they are comming from does not get netflix, So I expect them to respect border control rather than be sent back, and immigration services and have set a command undead symbol on the gate they came through to make sure they comply with authorities.
