        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since my arrival to this realm, I've noticed there arent many kitsunes going their day in this realm, and the talks of this... Council, I've seen. It all got me wondering, what is position of kitsunes in this realm and how are they treated, are they treated fairly, and such.
 As a kitsune, I grew interested to know how my beings are treated amongst wizards, witches, sorcerers, necromancers.
 and importantly, what are your thoughts on kitsunes, how do you see them?
 Sincerely, Kohaku.

The knowledge of every spider’s whereabouts and actions, their thoughts and sensations, was cut off by a dreamless slumber she forced upon them. Arach always enjoyed the time of day, and her own lack of need to sleep allowed her to enjoy it to the fullest. She sat upright in her bed, skimming over some biomancy research for the next day.

 He'd visited the Astral plenty of times before, of course. Not always on purpose... but he felt he'd become something of a pleasant surprise to Vashric and the Order.
 Well... a tolerated surprise perhaps. He did have a reputation for touching things he shouldn't.
 Something about the Astral always appealed to him. It felt easier to think clearly there, to breathe a little more freely. He was delighted to find the feeling was the same in this city.
