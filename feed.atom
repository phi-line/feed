        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(/uw A direct continuation of this post.)
 The Maggot Host marches through a wide valley in the southern border region between the Kingdom of Rando and the Republic of Knowhere. The Nurglite warriors’ footfalls can be heard for miles up and down the valley, and the reek of decaying flesh carries even further on the wind. Tamurkhan rides at the head of the enormous horde atop the toad dragon Bubebolos, followed by his lieutenants and elite warriors from each of his Infector Cohorts. Without warning, he raises his fist, signaling for the march to halt. Warband leaders copy the gesture all the way down the line, despite their confusion. Why has Tamurkhan chosen to stop here?
 When the cacophonous sound of steel-shod boots pounding against the earth dies away, the Maggot Lord and his mount tur…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posting on Aldin because The Null account is being buggy.
 The Void stretches infinitely, its silence suffocating. Null stands at its center—a shifting absence, darker than darkness, embodying the emptiness he seeks to reclaim for all existence. Before him, a figure emerges—not from the void, but as though they had always been present, their form defined by an aura of crushing weight as their very essence bends the void to their will... and this is but a projection...
 "You summoned me, Null," the figure intones, their voice a grinding pressure that echoes without sound.
 Null’s form quivers slightly under the oppressive force, but his resolve remains unshaken. He inclines toward them, as much an act of submission as one of purpose. "There is something I must show you."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Arcane source is perhaps the most intimate and personal of the four sources, as it originates from within. It is the wellspring of magic that resides in the soul, heart, or essence of the practitioner. Arcane magic represents raw, unfiltered power brought forth through discipline, willpower, and mastery over oneself.
 Let us begin.
 The Core of Arcane Magic: The Inner Spark
 At the heart of the Arcane lies the spark, a fragment of potential unique to every being capable of wielding it. This spark is the connection to the latent power within. While it is universally present, its strength varies widely among individuals. Some are born with a roaring inferno, others with a faint ember, but mastery depends not on the size of the spark, but on how it is nurtured and controlled.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Megacity of Den Ulock had fallen to the cult of Dominox. The Sect of Creation had been busy. Doing as their leader instructed, converting everyone they could, slaughtering everyone they couldn't. Most people joined of course, an army of cultists creating matter from nothing tend to be quite convincing. As the city fell, temples had been constructed at equal points around the city. Every single one was pointed towards Dominox's tree at the north edge.
 *In every single temple people had seen the Fanatical Leader sacrificing non-believers, muttering something to himself each time. No one had ever once seen him leave the temples, no one had ever seen him rest, no one had ever seen him eat. No one had ever seen him without his mask, naturally rumours began. Some said he had no face, some said he had been scarred heavily in a duel with a false god, some were stranger, saying he had the face of Dominox. When the Leader heard of the last one he gave a seven hour talk on how and why no one was worthy to have the face of Dominox.
 Debn Unlock had been changing, systems altered to suit the cults ideals. Shortly after the cults arrival the mayor had fled to find help, neither believing in Dominox nor wishing to be killed. Nine hours later news spread of her capture. She was due to be sacrificed today. However very few knew which of the seven temples she would be executed in.
 Travel in and out had been monitored, the Godless sinners could be anywhere afterall. Having nothing better to do than tear down everything the great Dominox stood for.

 Ten billion, of the fourty billion humans that have died without a sanctified burial, or that are not in hell have been cleared with passports to the living world. 
 They will be offered citizenship to my lands for surface in my army, but those that dont take the offer are free to walk the earth. Updates to translation spells are being put into place to make to ease communication with the dead languages they speak. 
 I have givin them a small amount of gold to pay thier way u till they get on thier feet, but its largly up to them to find a way to pay for a propper burial once they inevitably are bored of the mortal world and want to rest once more in an appropriate here after. 
 The limbo they are comming from does not get netflix, So I expect them to respect border control rather than be sent back, and immigration services and have set a command undead symbol on the gate they came through to make sure they comply with authorities.
