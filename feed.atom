        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Conqueror was immense. His power held countless lives on hundreds of realms, and with ever life enslaved, every being forced under his thumb, his power grew. But it wasn't his power. Some things are better left unknown. Some things are better left undisturbed. The Gauntlet is one of those things. It's past should have remained a mystery, it should have been left in the mountain it was imprisoned in.
 One such being, an ordinary librarian, was unfortunate enough to learn some of the Gauntlets secrets. Far off in a distant realm, there was a town. One day the librarian found a book on one of the shelves, one that shouldn't be there. Curious, he opened the book. The words swam across pages, rearranging themselves into sentences at random. It wasn't written in any known language, but he co…]]></summary>

 A hand unseen, a tale retold.
 Fate’s strings tighten, unseen they weave,
 A whispered truth none dare believe. 
 The widow strikes, her aim is true, Yet shadows shift, the sky turns blue.
 A story writ before she knew,
 A guiding hand she never drew. 
 The puppet dances, blind to thread,
 A gunshot sings, the sky turns red.
 And far beyond the waking mind,
 A weaver waits, his grasp entwined. 
 Samantha stood at the center of the Council’s grand chamber, her posture steady despite the tension coiling in the air. Around her, the curved rows of seats were packed with officials, wizards, and envoys from distant realms. Since Jester’s death, uncertainty had spread like a contagion.

 Down, down, down it goes—the lone Johnbot, sent by its creator on a mission of dire importance. Past even the Ninth Circle of Hell, the construct descends into the Pit—the namesake of Hell’s most formidable fiends. It’s almost like a miniature version of the Nine Circles, each section dedicated to a different stage in the perfection of law and malice.
 But delve too deep, and chaos begins to unfold. Locusts the size of horses, with scales of iron and faces of men, ravage the lower levels, awaiting the day of Armageddon to rise and consume all sinners. So fierce are these beasts of Hell that only one being could muster them—and the Johnbot had come to visit that man in particular: Abaddon, angel of the Abyss, Lord of the Pit, devil of the Apocalypse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Occult source of magic is enigmatic and deeply rooted in the ingenuity, ambition, and willpower of mortals. Unlike other sources that are inherent or divine in origin, Occult magic is a construct of mortal creativity, a product of ritual, symbols, and collective belief. It is as much about the unseen forces in the world as it is about the ingenuity of those who dare to reach for power beyond their natural means. Let’s break it down:
 The Core of Occult Magic: The Mortal Forge
 At its heart, the Occult is magic born from mortals themselves. It does not stem from a god's will, a personal spark, or the world around them, but from mortal knowledge and their relentless determination to bend reality to their will. 
 Ritualistic Power:
 Occult magic relies heavily on rituals, symbols, incanta…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Primal source of magic is the oldest and most untamed of the four. It is a force that lies outside the self, emanating from the natural world and the cosmic wilderness. Primal magic embodies life’s raw, chaotic energies and the ancient currents that pulse through the earth, sky, and stars. It is magic drawn from without, an unfiltered expression of nature’s power. Let’s explore its depths:
 The Core of Primal Magic: The Wild Pulse
 Primal magic flows from the universe’s living energy—a pulse that resonates in every aspect of existence. Unlike Arcane magic, which comes from within, Primal magic demands that practitioners connect with the world around them, attuning themselves to nature’s rhythm.
 Channels of Primal Magic:
 Primal magic is often found in the elemental forces: fire, water…]]></summary>
