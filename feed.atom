        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was terrifying... I was just at the tavern, hanging about, drinking ale, as one does. The day was perfectly calm until this strange person entered the tavern, covered in pale dust and in scandalous purple robes. This drunkard - I didn't know him personally but I've heard he be called 'Sbeve', something along those lines - he made the mistake of confronting this lunatic magician. He was all in his face, hurling insults, "you look like a moldy blueberry!" I remember was one of them. The mage didn't seem to notice him at first until... Brush This guy had just rested his arm on the man's shoulder, wiping away the dust on his skin. This was when the magician snapped, his face screwed like someone had just used power word: crunch. It didn't take long until there was an orange flash, and before me was no longer the drunkard but now a round, crispy, inch long chicken nugget.

Regardless of what they chose, everyone and everything bent the knee in time. One individual was more difficult to wrangle than most. Deep in the mountainous north regions of Xyreen, freedom was extremely abundant.
 The inhabitants did what they wanted to do when they wanted to do it. The abilities of the people varied, but one thing remained constant. In order to survive, you needed to fly. This didn't mean feathers but those without left one day and didn't come back. The colours varied almost as much as the abilities did, but more often than not the two matched. Those with red and orange usually meant fire, blue to bluish green typically meant aquatic abilities,…]]></summary>

 "What is Magic? This question is one many have pondered over time immemorial. Today, I shall provide... not an answer per say, but Insight."
 As he speaks, he begins drawing diagrams on a chalkboard, four circles, overlapping.
 "Magic is not merely a tool, nor a force to be wielded recklessly. It is the breath of existence itself, a symphony that hums within and beyond all things. To understand magic is to understand the very fabric of reality."
 He begins writing in the circles.

Fingering over the pages once more, she nodded then dog-eared the page with a careful crease and a pat. Getting hold of a braile printed Necronomicon was a nightmare, especially since she couldn't check any database or log to see if a library had it. Eventually she had decided "fuck it" and stole directly from the council's forbidden library- an act she definitely got some extra curses from. Still, it could've cut her arms off and she'd still say that it was..
 "Worth it" she said under her breath, pulling herself up over a lip on the wall to her right and grabbing a belt laiden with pouches and wrapping it around her waist.

 Thomas’s morning was probably the most peaceful that he’s had in a while. He was sitting in a recliner reading the paper. It talked about a military project being finished. He didn’t really understand it nor did he really care.
 Thomas looks over at Jay. He was sleeping on the sofa. Now that he thinks about it, this was probably the most peaceful morning the kid had in his entire life. He actually got to sleep in, he wasn’t traveling to some other island, and he wasn’t sleeping in the woods on his own. Now that he thought about it, he started to notice how much Jay hated mornings.
 Thomas chuckles to himself and goes back to reading his paper. At least he did until he heard a knock on the door. Thomas groans in annoyan…]]></summary>

 The Kingdom of Rando and the Republic of Knowhere had been fighting for weeks. Now their armies were engaged in fierce fighting in the hilly mountain region on their borders. While many of their mages were gone due to the previous attacks their more traditional forces were fighting in the narrow passes of the region and both sides were supplied with weapons from Shadeholme.
 In the middle of these clashes they felt a shift in the earth. Then a series of massive tunnels opened up at strategic points and the armies of Earth’s Embrace poured onto the surface. 
 The vanguard consisted of the newly reconstituted Stonebrea…]]></summary>

 Seraphim are superior celestial creature. They take the form of a montain sized bird with a snake like body and multiple sets of wings. Among the celestials they are the ones that posses the best planshifting abilities. Abilities that are at the very heart of their reproductive cycle
 They reproduce in the celestial realms but the only place they lay their eggs in is the deep layers of the abyss where the demon grow so big and strong that the most powerfull of them claim the title of demi god
 But once they are born the larvae have no predators
 They are born as tall and as long as a train with 4 wagons 
 Their fluff make them imunue to heat up to 6000000 K and down to 0 K 
 It is also a perfect electricity , humidity and magical isolant 
 The skin under it is 30 cm thick and extremely solid , the muscle fibers are stronger than spider silk fibers and are so thick that even when dead the larvae require more than 50 t of pressure to lift one of its leg a few millimetres . Dead they stand like statue for the rest of eternity
 In the abyss , killing a seraphim larvae is considered an exploit worthy of aquiring the status of demi god
