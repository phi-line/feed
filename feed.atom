        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I accomplished my goal of decimating this order of light wizards, even managed to groom their greatest champion into my own apprentice, i had hopes he would grow to surpass my own power! 
 Unfortunately while fighting his old master the fool lost half of his body and is now in a life support suit made by my artificers to keep him alive. Now he's a glorified attack dog instead of a successor.
 Does anyone else have a pitiful apprentice?

 All my father can talk about is how much better my brother is, and that im a failure for taking this long to restore him. Now he's taking over the world with zombies and im sitting pissed off in my manor, 
 Any advice?
