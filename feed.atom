Plus, if you’re feeling a little fearless, dishes like this are also a friend to those with one oven (hi!) and many things to reheat at once. My approach? I Jenga them. I stack rectangular and oval dishes two or three high in the oven, turning each so it steadies on the one below. Just don’t bump anything, okay?

Early Daoists cautioned against technologies that sully the spirit and ignite chaos. The Zhuangzi [one of the foundational texts of Daoism] warns against the use of “clever machines” and suggests that they are better left alone by those walking the righteous path. This is not unlike the apprehension that many European intellectuals harbored toward the technologies of their respective times, whether that be the early widespread resistance in Western Europe to Hindu-Arab numerals, the reluctance of the Catholic Church to embrace perspectival painting and scientific method in the early Renaissance, or the anxiety that swept over the European continent during the introduction o…]]></summary>

The writing is in cuneiform script, patterns of largely wedge-­shaped lines that were impressed with a sharpened reed onto tablets of softened and leather-­hard clay, eventually baked to ensure their preservation.
A word for wind exists in Sumerian —­ it is lil. The lexical story of this particular word is a little more complicated, however, since Sumerians, as far as we know, may well have been aware of wind and its effects, yet did not fully understand what caused the air —­ which was also invisible, of course —­ to move.

Nearly half of U.S. adults report feeling lonely; only one in five employees say they have a close friend at work; and according to the Pew Research Center declining trust costs the economy an estimated 1–2% of GDP each year through friction and inefficiency. The U.S. Surgeon General has warned that loneliness now rivals smoking in its impact on health.
At the 2025 Volunteering Reconnected Summit in Silicon Valley — hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Connection and co-sponsored by Big Think — leaders from business, government, academia, and the social sector gathered to discuss community service, and its untapped potential to rebuild human connection at scale.

An isolated galaxy still moves through the abyss of deep space: where a rarified, sparsely populated sea of ions (mostly protons and electrons) still persists. There may only be about one particle per cubic meter populating the intergalactic medium, on average, but considering that galaxies are frequently 100,000 light-years across or even more, they do encounter large numbers of particles, particularly at higher speeds.
This effect gets more and more severe for galaxies that move at faster speeds through the intergalactic medium, and also for environments where t…]]></summary>

After the iPod’s launch in October 2001 — “1,000 songs in your pocket" — Apple sold 125,000 units of the new device by the end of the year. In March 2002, Apple introduced a version with 10GB of storage (approximately 2,000 songs). But it wasn’t until August 2002, with the second generation iPod, that the real growth began. That was when Windows support was added, via software called MusicMatch Jukebox. iPod 2 also doubled the maximum storage capacity, from 10GB to 20GB — enough to hold 35-40 albums, which felt like a proper record collection.

The hammer extends our fist, the spear our teeth, the hut our skin, the wheel our feet — and electronic media extend our central nervous system to all of humankind. 
Extended abilities give us new powers but disrupt previous sensory, cognitive, and social settings. As humankind switched to the internet, printing no longer defines the protocols humans live by. Print-based culture is collapsing. 
The era of printing was, in fact, very short by historical standards — about 550 years. Some call this period the Gutenberg Parenthesis — a metaphor popularized by Jeff Jarvis. Within this Parenthesis, communication was centered around fixed, authored, linear, and stable texts.

Share your questions for Meera Sodha, Tim Dowling and Stuart Heritage for a special Guardian Live event on Wednesday 26 November.


Egg foo yung is a type of omelette that perhaps began life as a type of egg dish in Guangdong province, but has since the early 1900s been a staple on American and British Chinese takeaway menus. I like to order it at Yau’s in Broughton near Scunthorpe or Chi’s in Kenton in Devon, where it arrives as a small, fluffy, delicate omelette, barely able to hold itself together for the amount of vegetables woven into it. Over rice, it is a form of heaven on a Saturday night. I haven’t tried to replicate that specific joy here, but this is a homespun version, for those Saturdays when neither Chi’s nor Yau’s are within range.
Join Meera Sodha at a special event celebrating the best of Guardian culture on Wednesday 26 November, hosted by Nish Kumar and alongside writers Stuart Heritage and Tim Dowling, with Georgina Lawton hosting You be the judge live. Live in London or via livestream, book tickets here.

This belief only shifted around the 1500s, says Jason Crawford, founder of The Roots of Progress and the author of The Techno-Humanist Manifesto. The idea that progress would automatically continue became widespread, until the first World War shattered the illusion that technology would bring peace and cooperation. 
Out of this rose a counterculture concern that modernity was a mistake, that progress itself was the problem. But was it? Are we now moving backwards? How can we regain trust in pushing forward?

Some books take a more direct approach: They explicitly aim to change how readers live their lives. They may be shelved in philosophy, psychology, or self-help, but their goal is to help you find perspective, search for meaning, or guide you to find your purpose so that when the end inevitably comes, you can look back on your life with gratitude and contentment.

Chief among these constants are h, Planck’s constant that governs quantum physics, c, the speed of light in a vacuum that’s the same for all observers, and G, the gravitational constant that was introduced by Newton and that remains, even today, as an inseparable part of Einstein’s field equations in General Relativity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“While I breathe, I hope,” the most well-known of South Carolina’s two mottos, must have resonated deeply in the hearts and minds of enslaved Blacks as the first bombs exploded over Charleston Harbor. It was here, at 4:30 a.m. on April 12, 1861, that the Civil War began. Until then, the enslaved, who made up most of Charleston’s population, had found little reason for hope. They were held in bondage, forced to labor long hours with no pay, provided inadequate food and shelter, and under threat of physical abuse or even death at the slightest provocation. The blasts that lit up the night sky represented the first real chance for them to realize their collective dream to breathe free.
Among them was Robert Smalls, an intelligent young man who would not be willing to simply wait. If not for t…]]></summary>

If you have no rest mass as you travel through the vacuum of space, you absolutely are compelled to travel exactly at the speed of light. This is exactly true for all massless particles, like photons and gluons, approximately true for particles whose mass is tiny compared to their kinetic energy, like neutrinos, and should also be exactly true for the massless ripples in spacetime created by purely gravitational effects: gravitational waves. Irrespective of whether gravity itself is inherently quantum in nature, the speed of gravity must be exactly equal to the speed of light. At least, that’s a necessity if we assume that our current laws of physics are correct.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Philosophers often like to talk about “emergence,” a process where various discrete items come together to form something entirely new. It’s when a new property, a new object, or a new perspective emerges from the sum of the parts. We often talk differently about the emergent property than the individual elements. For example, we talk about a traffic jam differently than the cars that make it up.
One key question is: To what extent should we view society as an emergent property? In some ways, “society” has its own flow. It can create money, make laws, and shape collective behavior. When people compare a state’s budget to a household, it’s disingenuous — the state is not a parent with a credit card. Talking about society is often different from talking about individuals.

We were more than that, and the name needed to reflect as much.
We had to take stock of the values we would want that name to represent. Initially, I considered the potential benefits of a name that might confer a sense of company continuity and familiarity. Perhaps it should invoke IBM’s nickname, and we could call our project teams Big Blue teams. But the risk would be that while dropping the baggage associated with “design,” we’d be taking on some new Blue-colored baggage instead. …]]></summary>

From Einstein’s spacetime theory to the brain’s internal clock, they examine whether time is an external property of the universe or a mental construct. By connecting physics and neuroscience, they unpack the idea that how we experience time may differ entirely from how it actually works.

and claims that the supernova data has been misinterpreted and the Universe is slowing down, not accelerating.
None of these things are true, of course, despite the assertions of the researchers who originated these claims.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nearly 50 years ago, Klaus Biemann, a principal investigator for NASA’s Viking Mars landing mission, announced that, after careful study of data collected by the landers’ onboard instruments, they had detected no organic compounds on the Martian surface. The Viking science team issued a broad conclusion: Mars was lifeless.
But data from the life-detection experiments was ambiguous. In fact, three different Viking instruments — the Labelled Release experiment to test for metabolic processes; the Pyrolytic Release experiment to test for organic synthesis reactions, and the Gas Exchange experiment to measure exchange of gases that might be biological in origin — returned data that were hard for scientists to interpret at the time.

The other morning, I was on a Zoom call with a CEO, trying to sound composed, when my four-year-old burst into the room demanding to know where her princess dress was. I glanced down at my to-do list — which never seems to get shorter — and noticed I still needed to book a trip to San Francisco.
In that moment, surrounded by chaos, I thought: I write a column called The Long Game. I’m supposed to be the guy who thinks in decades. In all candor, I’m usually just trying to make it to lunchtime.
And maybe that’s why my conversation with Scott Britton hit home.

We have some supremely strong evidence that indicates there must be a pathway for that to occur: the existence of Earth and the other planets orbiting our own Sun. Because we exist, and our planet and the other planets in the Solar System exist, then the Universe must have some way of creating these planets.
So how is it, exactly, that planets actually form within our Universe?
To answer that question, we need to look to the Universe itself. Sure, we have theories that detail how planets could form, and by combining two fields of astronomy that might s…]]></summary>

What we now know as the “social web” — or Web 2.0 — didn’t arrive until around 2004. But the first inklings of it were emerging a couple of years before. As usual, music was the harbinger.
Last.fm was founded in 2002 by a group of four Austrian and German students from Ravensbourne College of Design and Communication in London. It was fashioned as an internet radio station that allowed a user to build a listening profile and share it with others. The year of its launch, Last.fm won a young talent award at the Europrix, a multimedia awards show based in Vienna. This was how the product was described in a showcase video (embedded below) leading up to the awards ceremony:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the great discoveries to be made out there in the grand scheme of things is alien life: the first detection of life that originated, survives, and continues to live beyond our own home planet of Earth. An even grander goal that many of us have, including scientists and laypersons alike, is to find not just life, but an example of intelligent extraterrestrials: aliens that are capable of interstellar communication, interstellar travel, or even of meeting us, physically, on our own planet. It’s a fascinating dream that has been with humanity since we first began contemplating the stars and planets beyond our own world.



Most of us, including me, personally, have assumed that this latter type of alien would not only be more technologically advanced than we are, but would also be far more scientifically advanced as well. That not only would they understand everything we presently do about the fundamental laws of physics, but far more: that they’d be a potential source of new knowledge for us, having equaled or exceeded everything we’d already gleaned from our investigative endeavors. And that assumption, as compelling as it might be, could be completely in error, argues physicist and author Dr. Daniel Whiteson.



That’s why I’m so pleased to bring you this latest episode of the Starts With A Bang podcast, where Daniel and I meet to discuss this very topic, with me taking the side of my own human-centered assumptions and Daniel taking a far more broad, philosophical, and cosmic approach: the same approach he takes in his new book, Do Aliens Speak Physics? And Other Questions About Science and the Nature of Reality. Have a listen to this fascinating conversation, see which set of arguments you find more compelling, and check out his book. You won’t be disappointed!

A confession: I have already written a recipe for massaman curry. But since that was published in 2018, I have had a baby, a breakdown, travelled back to Thailand and eaten more massaman curries, all events that have contributed to this new recipe. The old dish is delicious, but in 2025 I didn’t want to make a paste from scratch. Instead, I wanted the funk and soul that a ready-made curry paste could give me and to use that as a springboard to fly into dinner time. A shortcut on time and ingredients, yes, but not on fun and flavour.
Join Meera Sodha at a special event celebrating the best of Guardian culture on Wednesday 26 November, hosted by Nish Kumar and alongside writers Stuart Heritage and Tim Dowling, with Georgina Lawton hosting You Be The Judge live. Live in London or via livestream, book tickets here.

Neuroscientist Anil Seth argues that consciousness isn’t a mysterious spark but a deeply biological process, one that depends on prediction, perception, and the body’s constant negotiation with the world. 
In this conversation with philosopher Jonny Thomson, he explores how our brains don’t passively observe reality, but rather actively construct it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What makes something sacred? According to actor and author Rainn Wilson, it depends on how we look at it. 
At A Night of Awe and Wonder, hosted by Freethink Media and the John Templeton Foundation, Rainn Wilson recalls the most holy night of his life: when his wife and newborn survived a near-fatal birth. Looking into his son’s eyes for the first time, he describes feeling God, the universe, and life in a way he never had before, or since. 
This brought him to a greater conclusion, that true sacred experience can be found beyond religion and ritual. In fact, it is our ability to experience awe and wonder that can unite us. It lives in acts of courage and kindness, and it’s our shared capacity for awe in the face of that beauty, Wilson suggests, that can bring us closer together.

There’s matter: both normal matter and dark matter, in all the forms they can take, from plasmas to stars to black holes to diffuse, fluffy haloes. There’s dark energy: a mysterious form of energy that appears to be inherent to the fabric of space itself, consistent with Einstein’s cosmological constant. And there’s also radiation: like photons of all different wavelengths and neutrinos when they move nearly at the speed of light. But gravitational waves, even though they aren’t represented by any component of the Standard Model of elementary particles, also exist in our Universe, and also behave as a form of radiation: an inherently gravitational one.

They saw themselves as unusually clear-headed and logical — people determined to build a society based on reason rather than on the accidents of tradition. If there was a better way to do something, they wanted to find it.
At first, the experiment went smoothly. They shared work, rotated responsibilities, and debated policy late into the night. But before long, they started to complain about English. It’s irrational, they said. Silent letters everywhere, no phonetic consistency, spelling rules that dissolve the moment you learn them. Why do “though,” “through,” and “tough” all look the same but sound nothing alike? And the idioms! Why should “kick the bucket” mean “die”? Surely a truly rational society can do better, they though…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the latest edition of The Long Game, I spoke with Andrew Markell, a conversation based on several interviews over the past few months.
Earlier this year, Andrew and I were introduced through a mutual friend. We first met in person on a trail in Forest Park in Portland, Oregon, where we hiked for two hours, talking about how societies — and people — fracture under pressure. A couple of weeks later, I found myself in his driveway, sweat pouring down my back as we practiced yiquan, the martial art he’s mastered, and a technique that trains the nervous system to stay coherent under stress.
Andrew is part philosopher, part fighter — a trauma specialist and co-founder of The Dawn Collective — and he’s spent decades teaching everyone from special forces veterans to investors to CEOs how to fi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No matter how advanced our civilization here on Earth becomes, there’s a sobering fact we have no choice but to reckon with: Earth’s resources are finite. That not only includes the resources we typically think of, like minerals, clean water, and breathable air, but also something even more fundamental and restrictive: land area. No matter how thoroughly we develop, there’s only a finite amount of land area to even potentially inhabit on our planet. Even if we built cities atop our existing cities, beneath them in subterranean passages, or floating atop the oceans, the fact is we’re living on a planet with a finite area and a finite volume, fundamentally limiting our ability to expand. 
Even if we develop floating cities, the finite surface area of planet Earth ensures that, beyond a certa…]]></summary>

Laughter is a noun with many possible adverbs. This raises a problem for anyone wanting to tell a joke. Because a joke, at its most basic, is something that is intended to make someone laugh. And so, given the sheer variety of laughter, it makes sense that there’s an equally sheer variety of jokes. A joke might be good-natured or mean. It might be childish or intellectual. It might be universal or niche. It might be about a social norm or about a specific person. Different jokes for different laughter.

The answer wasn’t flattering. What I’d written sounded smart, but it wasn’t clear. I realized I’d been unconsciously filtering ideas through “does this make me look clever?” instead of “will this help the reader?”
Once I noticed I was optimizing for the wrong outcome, I could change it. I started asking different questions: Is this clear? Will this example actually land? What am I assuming the reader already knows?
That shift — becoming aware of how I was evaluating my own work — changed how I approached the rest of the book.

It was called Liber Abaci, The Book of Calculations, and in it Fibonacci set out algebraic principles that, essentially, enabled merchants to make money. He had the journalistic gift of making the strange seem commonplace and the tangential seem relevant. By posing real-life examples of conundrums faced by traders, Fibonacci brought maths to life.

Many of these so-called “nones” look to science alone to tell them what is real. They’re four times more likely than believers to say “the natural world is all there is,” and far less likely to think science has limits.
But lately, something seems to be shifting. Across the U.S., more people describe themselves as “spiritual but not religious.” In the U.K., Gen Z church attendance is ticking up. Meditation retreats sell out, ayahuasca is a household name, and “energy work” has its own subreddit.

Together, they explain how accepting “good enough” and finding value beyond work can lead to greater balance and lasting happiness.

The only absolute, Einstein contended, was the speed of light in a vacuum. This was indeed a revolutionary statement, but the formulas for working out how distances and durations changed in a velocity-dependent way, especially as you approached the speed of light, had already been worked out over a decade prior: the Lorentz transformations.

The dot-com crash had drained Silicon Valley’s exuberance, Napster was being dismantled in court, and the new wave of post-9/11 “warblogs” made the internet feel solemn and overly serious. Meanwhile, Microsoft continued its dominance over the web with the release of Internet Explorer 6.
Despite the doom and gloom, 2001 was also a year in which the web continued to mature.

How do we manipulate symbols in meaningful ways? This naturally brings us to one of the six ideas central to AI today. It’s an idea for manipulating symbols, and it is ridiculously simple: You can reduce many problems to searching for an answer.
This sounds not just simple but self-­evident, so let me make it a little more complex. You can reduce many problems in AI to the computer searching its internal representation of the world from the symbol representing the starting state to the symbol representing the goal state.
This is not a new idea. It’s called navigation. You search a map for the route from your starting position to your desired end position. We do this al…]]></summary>

How did Jobs do it? How did he revolutionize tech, not once but continually?
To find out, I visit engineering teams at Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California. Snooping nosily around their sunny offices, I ask if they can share Jobs’s secret to innovation. In response, they laugh. They tell me that Apple has lost the secret. If I want to find it, I should go read a biography of Jobs. The most useful one, they tell me, is by Walter Isaacson.

When lower-mass, Sun-like stars run out of fuel, they blow off their outer layers in a planetary nebula, but the center contracts down to form a white dwarf, which takes a very long time to fade to darkness. Some white dwarfs will shine for trillions of years; others are on their way to an inevitable supernova when they collide with another white dwarf or accumulate enough mass to detonate.

I’ve been decluttering lately: throwing away or organising old cards, letters and photos, placing them in zipped folders and zapping them with labels made on my beloved Dymo. It’s given me such a great sense of freedom and clarity that I was thinking: I should do the same for my recipes. This one, for example, I would file under “magic”, because it comes together (mostly) from the store-cupboard, both in that easy way in which you throw things into a pot until they alchemise, but also because tahini and beans, together with a lemon, can, magically, become the most soothing antidote to cold weather.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve inherited the history of Ancient Rome through movies, ruins, and shallow stories. The truth is far messier, says classicist Mary Beard. The hidden side of Roman life that screens rarely capture is chaotic; crowded streets teeming with Romans whose everyday lives were shaped by social hierarchies and  familial obligations. 
Mary Beard unpacks what archaeology, literature, and even shoes tell us about the Romans’ daily lives. From the role of slaves in dressing elites to the rowdy crowds at chariot races, she shows how we’ve underestimated their complexity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the 1920s, the first pieces of crucial evidence came in that indicated a truth about our reality that we’ve been stuck with ever since: the Universe is expanding. This simple fact has led to an enormous suite of subsequent discoveries: the hot Big Bang, the cosmic microwave background, the growth of the large-scale structure of the Universe over cosmic time, and much more. It’s also led to a profound existential question: how will the Universe end? If it’s expanding, which it is, and the expansion rate has decreased over time, which the evidence also supports, then what will happen in the far future? Will the expansion continue forever? Will it continue to decrease, or will it increase again? And if it does decrease, will it ever drop to zero and then, afterwards, reverse itself?

Only then were the rest of us allowed to search deep into the woods without using butcher knives to cut through the thick brush and twigs, as the drill sergeants had proposed, and without a Thermos of water or fruit to keep us hydrated, as the cooks had suggested, because all we really needed was one another.

Everywhere I turn — podcasts, research calls, dinner conversations — people are talking about “toxic workplaces.” The phrase has become ubiquitous; almost unavoidable.
So I did what most researchers do when they’re curious (or procrastinating): I Googled it.
That led me to a chart showing the term’s meteoric rise beginning in the early 2010s. The curve shoots upward like a fever.
This is the chart:

Around 500 years ago, there was really only one scientific phenomenon that was, without controversy, extremely well-understood: the motion of the celestial objects in the sky. The Sun rose in the east and set in the west with a regular, 24 hour period. Its path in the sky rose higher and the days grew longer until the summer solstice, while its path was the lowest and shortest on the winter solstice: part of the annual cycle. The motions of the stars also exhibited a similar 24 hour period, as though the heavenly canopy rotated throughout the night. The Moon migrated night-to-night relative to the other objects by about 12° as it changed its phases, while …]]></summary>

Spain’s King Philip II certainly did. His fever dream of world domination was called “la Empresa de China,” or “the Chinese Job.” And yes, it was as unhinged as this map suggests.
The plan to turn Ming-dynasty China into an outpost of Habsburg-era Spain didn’t come out of nowhere, though. It was hatched toward the end of the 16th century, when Spain had been on a century-long winning streak of divine luck and ruthless efficiency.
Soon after Columbus stumbled across the Americas (in 1492), Cortés toppled the Aztec Empire (in 1521), and Pizarro did the same with the Inca one (in 1533). Those quick victories seemed nothing less than providential. …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On a tiny atoll in the Indian Ocean, there lives a flightless bird called the Aldabra rail. It looks unassuming enough — brown feathers, chicken-sized, and incapable of flying.
Roughly 136,000 years ago, its ancestors — white-throated rails from Madagascar — flew to Aldabra and found a predator-free paradise; no sharp-toothed prowlers or featherless bipeds with pointy sticks. And so, the rails evolved into flightless versions. Why waste effort and energy on flying when there’s no point?
Then came a catastrophic flood. The island went underwater. The rails couldn’t fly, and they couldn’t swim. They went extinct. And then, after the seas receded, something eerie happened. More rails flew back — their distant ancestors, still strong in Madagascar, made the same flight again. And the story rep…]]></summary>

Philosopher Meghan Sullivan, PhD, Buddhist scholar and former monk Thupten Jinpa, PhD, and meditation teacher Sharon Salzberg explore love through neuroscience, philosophy, and lived practice. They discuss society’s flaw in mistaking kindness for weakness, how neuroscience has proven to identify compassion in brain scans, and how expanding Aristotle’s Love Ethic can change our society for the better.
We created this video for Brain Briefs, a Big Think interview series created in partnership with Unlikely Collaborators.

Copernicus famously recognized that the Earth wasn’t a privileged location, and was just an ordinary planet orbiting the Sun like Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn were. Similarly, our cosmic location, including our time after the Big Bang and place in the Local Group, have nothing “special” about them.

At the beginning of 2001, most popular weblogs were a combination of personal journal and linkblog — a format encouraged by early blogging tools like Blogger, LiveJournal and Diaryland. But by the end of the year, blogging had become a real-time reporting tool too; most notably in the form of the “warblogs” that became popular after 9/11, like Talking Points Memo, Instapundit and Andrew Sullivan’s The Daily Dish. The October launch of Movable Type was also a key moment in the professionalisation of blogging.
But let's start in January 2001, with the first annual Weblog Awards. This was a hobby site run by Nikolai Nolan, a University of Michigan student, who defined a weblog as “a page with dated entries that frequently have off-site link…]]></summary>

No, you decide, and opt for a newer book that is currently trending on social media.

Looking back, the through line was learning to understand unseen systems and building machines that could navigate them.
Then, in 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished. I followed the search closely, and it left me unsettled.

All trends have one thing in common: they sure seemed like a good idea at the time and ostensibly serve some purpose, despite looking silly in hindsight. My junior high school yearbook picture drives that truth home.

That opening sentence was lifted wholesale from Wikipedia, the revolutionary online encyclopedia that elevated Wales into cultural legend. As he details in his new book The Seven Rules of Trust: A Blueprint for Building Things That Last, the ascent was anything but smooth.
Wikipedia launched on January 15, 2001, and by 2006 was being roundly mocked on The Colbert Report as a disinformation train primed for derailment by the meddling demons of human nature — but the “pathological optimist” in Wales refused to concede that his venture, and by extension the entire concept, was doomed. 
His instincts were, to say the least, solid. The English Wikipedia is now r…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few years ago, I was scheduled to present an important keynote in Canada—one of my first large speaking opportunities. It came after weeks of travel, intensive client work, and nonstop video editing. In short, I was burned out before I even stepped onstage.
After rushing to the venue from my international flight, I stood in the green room, my hands sweaty from nerves. I hadn’t slept well in days while juggling a massive client fire, and though I had rehearsed the talk several times, I was still consumed with thoughts like “What if it all falls apart?” When I walked onstage, I realized I’d forgotten to bring the clicker for the slides. I had to greet the audience and then casually return offstage to get it. About five slides in, I felt an unpleasant energy change.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When life feels overwhelming, Berkeley professor Dacher Keltner turns to one emotion he believes can transform everything: Awe.
Through his research into vocal bursts, Keltner discovered that awe even sounds the same across cultures, including in some of the most remote regions of the world. He and his team collected stories of awe from 26 countries, identifying eight universal sources of this emotion shared across humanity, from moral beauty to collective effervescence. Even one minute of awe per day, he explains, can help us heal loneliness, grief, and even physical ailments. 
At A Night of Awe & Wonder, hosted by Big Think and the John Templeton Foundation, Keltner invites all of us to rediscover awe, a force for connection and healing in our modern lives.

Sure, we already knew about General Relativity, the existence of subatomic particles, knowledge of radioactivity, and the beginnings of quantum mechanics. But we had yet to discover the expanding Universe and reveal the Big Bang, to recognize that the fields as well as the particles composing the Universe quantum in nature, or to learn that protons were composed of still smaller, more fundamental entities: the quarks and gluons.  The big puzzles of today, including dark matter, dark energy, and the origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry, could hardly have been fathomed at the time.

In the process, I’ve watched warfighters, technologists, and commanders at every level grapple with a new operational reality: one where centralized command must coexist with decentralized execution; where emerging technologies live beside legacy systems; and where speed and stability must be pursued simultaneously.
It’s not just complexity. It’s contradiction. And oddly enough, it’s where creativity begins. We often think of innovation as the product of big ideas hatched by disruptors, visionaries, lone geniuses.

Possible fates of the expanding Universe. Notice the differences between models in the past; only a Universe with dark energy matches our observations, and the dark energy-dominated solution came from de Sitter all the way back in 1917. By observing the expansion rate today and measuring the components present in the Universe, we can determine both its future and past histories.

Back in 2020, I put some curry cubes in my husband Hugh’s Christmas stocking, and our life (particularly his) was cleaved in two: before curry cubes, and after. He took them camping and on cycling trips, and he raved about them to friends. Slowly, they became a pantry staple for us. When I have the time, I like to batch-cook my own curry sauce and freeze it, but when there isn’t time, we love this meal. It feels embarrassingly easy to make, because the cubes bring all the flavour, and also quite fancy at the same time thanks to the egg yolk. We love it, and I hope you will, too.

Its creator offered would-be customers access to a large language model (LLM) with no built-in guardrails — one that wouldn’t push back when asked to do something nefarious, like craft a scam email, write code for malware, or help with a phishing scheme. He later claimed that more than 200 users paid upwards of €500 (around $540) per month for the tool, with some shelling out as much as €5,000 ($5,400) for a full-featured private installation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In many ways, our modern picture of the Universe got its start in the 1920s. In that one decade, we discovered that the spiral and elliptical nebulae in the sky were actually galaxies, far beyond the extent of our own Milky Way. We measured the distance to these galaxies, determining that the farther away they were, on average, the faster they appeared to be speeding away from us. And we calculated that a Universe that was uniformly filled with “stuff” — whether matter, radiation, a cosmological constant, or any other form of energy — would be unable to be static and stable; it must either expand or contract.
From these revolutionary realizations, the notion of the expanding Universe was born. Over the past century, we’ve learned much more about the history and properties of our Universe. …]]></summary>

Triumph. I had freedom and unlimited time. What could be easier? A lot, it turns out. Weeks went by, and I did not write. My inbox began to fill with cheerful nudges from Stephen, my editor. Still keen to write something?
The first time around had been cleaner. I’d been assigned a slot in Big Think’s consciousness issue on a tight deadline. That forced me to write about the neuroscience behind sleep, a relevant topic I knew well enough to write cold. There was no dithering, just a window of opportunity narrowing by the minute.

But drop me off in the middle of the woods with a destination, and you’d better tell the park rangers what you did, or I’m in trouble. Give me a compass if you want; the only difference will be the false sense of confidence I’ll take with me while getting lost.

For the uninitiated, Yudkowsky is no fringe voice. He founded the Machine Intelligence Research Institute. He helped define the “alignment problem” — how to make sure superintelligent systems share human values. Wherever you land on the AI spectrum — doomer, accelerationist, or just uneasily curious — his words, I think, are worth reading.
Yes, technology has lifted billions and reshaped civilization. But humans have a terrible record when it comes to hubris. I don’t share his certainty that we’re doomed. But I do share his suspicion that history is, once again, repeating — brilliant people, good int…]]></summary>

Sometimes, a surprising set of observations supports a once-discredited theory, bringing it back into prominence. And at other times, it isn’t new data that elevates a contrarian viewpoint, but rather a false narrative is the culprit, as disingenuous arguments that have been rightfully dismissed by mainstream professionals suddenly take hold among either a new generation of inexperienced individuals, or outsiders who haven’t been exposed to the wide array of mainstream fact…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[People really like Japanese philosophy. If you ever see a list of “untranslatable words” or “beautiful words from around the world,” then you will notice how Japanese ideas are often overrepresented. Whenever I explore a Japanese concept on the Mini Philosophy social media pages — wabi–sabi, mono no aware, ikigai — they outperform almost everything else.
Part of this, no doubt, is a kind of exoticism. For much of its history, Japan remained ethnically and culturally distinct from both its Asian neighbors and the wider world. Buddhism drifted over from China and Korea, but it fused with Shinto and indigenous animism to become something uniquely Japanese. Western industrialism arrived in the 19th century under the Meiji Restoration, but even then, Japan found a way to absorb foreign ideas wi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There have been those who thought broadly about play and recognized its importance for adults. One of the first was the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga. In 1938, when he published his seminal book on play, Homo ludens, it was quite radical to argue that play was a central organizing force in human culture. But that’s what Huizinga did. 
“For many years the conviction has grown upon me, that civilization arises and unfolds in and as play,” he wrote. 
Huizinga saw play permeating language, myth, and ritual, all of which he considered root forces guiding human societies. He also developed one of the first important and lasting definitions of play. He pointed out that play is fun, it is voluntary, it’s a freedom.

Instead, she runs through a series of questions: “What needs to be true for that to happen? Is it a physics problem? Or a manufacturing one?” Her no-nonsense “bullshit” test has made her a trusted advisor to venture capitalists and founders alike. 
Right now, Marchenkova’s pragmatism feels especially prescient. After several years of contracting funding, quantum technology is entering a renewed wave of investment. Funding in Q1 of 2025 for quantum companies reached $1.25 billion, roughly double that of the year before, and according to McKinsey, the total quantum market is predicted to be worth about $198 billion by 2040.

This tremendously successful theory gave us everything from gravitational waves to black holes based on one profound insight: that the fabric of spacetime itself would evolve, curve, and even ripple based on the properties and behavior of the matter and energy within it. When we applied Einstein’s equations to the entire Universe as a whole, along with the idea that the Universe was filled nearly uniformly with matter and energy on the largest scales, we wound up with an expanding Universe. Extrapolating back in time, we arrived at a very hot, dense, and uniform early state, where all of the Universe’s matter and energy was concentrated into a tiny, minuscule volume.

Science, too, has generally seen this border as impenetrable.

By 2.7 billion years ago, it had developed photosynthesis. A little later, aerobic respiration developed, followed by eukaryotic cells, multicellularity, and sexual reproduction. More than half a million years ago, the first fungi, plants, and animals appeared, leading to a planet whose continents and oceans were overrun with large, complex, differentiated organisms. With the arrival of human beings, Earth has become a planet dominated by an intelligent, technologically advanced, on the cusp of even being a spacefaring species.

At the event, Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle demonstrated the new time machine by pulling up a web page from the White House website from September 10, 1996, featuring President Clinton declaring the prevention of hijacking and terrorist attacks in the air a priority.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For most of human history, we could only imagine what made us who we are. Then, just over two decades ago, the Human Genome Project — the international scientific effort to decode the three billion letters of human DNA — changed everything. 
Critics at the time called it too expensive, too ambitious, too abstract. And they weren’t wrong. It was the largest biology project ever proposed, and scientists hadn’t even managed to sequence the smallest bacterial genome yet. But the organizers knew that big plans — moonshots — inspire people and attract funding. 
Today, nearly every advance in modern medicine rests on its foundation. The project transformed biology into an information science, spawning ancestry testing, virus tracking, precision cancer therapies, the first personalized medicines, …]]></summary>

So, she books a few viewings with her real estate agent and starts looking at houses. After looking at three places, she falls in love: It’s a house with a huge backyard and a nice open-plan kitchen. What’s more, the school down the road has a great reputation. She’s all set to put in an offer.
But that night a question pops into her head: What if the next house is better? She can’t shake the thought. What if the next house has a bigger backyard, or maybe a double garage? What if it’s cheaper?!

In my book, The Visual Detox, I explore how the images we’re exposed to shape our inner balance, for better or worse — and I demonstrate how art can gently tip the scales back toward harmony.
Think of visual art as a toolkit to soothe the mind and spirit. Every day, we are inundated with imagery urging us to work harder, buy more … and never stop. Art offers the exact opposite. It slows and calms us down, sharpens our critical thinking, nurtures happiness, and helps us resist the endless cycle of consumption. In contrast to the ever-present commercial visuals found on our streets and screens, in train stations and airports, engaging with art gives us a brea…]]></summary>

In it, he called for the destruction of the Treaty of Versailles, the creation of a new German Reich through territorial expansion, and the removal of Jews from German life. 
Fourteen years later, on September 30, 1938, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain returned from Munich to cheering crowds after concluding a meeting with the same Hitler. Waving a signed piece of paper, he assured his audience that “peace for our time” had been secured. Chamberlain, an experienced diplomat, believed he had persuaded Hitler to abandon the very ambitions he had once gone to prison for attempting to achieve.

Free speech scholar Jacob Mchangama warns that AI’s growing role in search, email, and word processing means its hidden biases could shape freedom of thought itself. With his team at the Future of Free Speech, Mchangama ran an experiment that tested 268 prompts against popular LLMs and found that the results often reflected inconsistent standards. According to Mchangama, this shows why ownership of AI models matters, since their values, incentives, and pressures ultimately shape public access to information.

No-waste cooking comes in many forms. It doesn’t have to mean cooking banana peel. To me, it means finishing a bag of potatoes before they grow eyes, and making the most of that last awkward bit of cabbage. Even finding a cheeky new way with the sauces and condiments already in the fridge. Using ingredients you’ve already got to make a new recipe is, in my opinion, the most “no waste” of them all. So here’s permission from me to make substitutes – herb for herb, veg for veg, or anything you’ve already got – to make this recipe work for you.

How do people respond to fear and stress? How do soldiers assess risk or make life-or-death decisions?

Do you like the Mediterranean? Should we make more seas like it?
Today, the Mediterranean region is one of the best places in the world to live, with an amazing climate, developed economies, and some of the best beaches on Earth — but it wasn’t always like this.
Roughly six million years ago, shifting tectonic plates closed the Strait of Gibraltar — a narrow body of water connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean — turning the area into a desertic wasteland. About 700,000 years later, the strait burst open again, and a brutal megaflood filled the Mediterranean in a matter of months.

to measure the expansion rate of the Universe today, known as the Hubble constant,
and to measure how the expansion rate was changing over time, then known as the deceleration parameter.
After all, we had a law of gravity — Einstein’s General Relativity — that allowed us to calculate how the Universe would evolve based on the amount, density, and distribution of matter and energy within it. We observed the Universe to be roughly uniform in all locations and all directions, and we learned back in the 1920s and 1930s that the Universe was expanding. If we could just measure those two parameters, we thought, we’d know it all: the age, history, composition, and even the fate of our Universe.

“The fundamental laws that govern the smallest constituents of matter and energy, when applied to the Universe over long enough cosmic timescales, can explain everything that will ever emerge.”
This means that the formation of literally everything in our Universe, from atomic nuclei to atoms to simple molecules to complex molecules to life to intelligence to consciousness and beyond, can all be understood as something that emerges directly from the fundamental laws underpinning reality, with no additional laws, forces, or interactions required.

This week, for my Long Game column in Big Think, I spoke with him about his recent book — Buffett and Munger Unscripted — which draws entirely from primary sources: decades of Berkshire Hathaway transcripts and letters.
Many books have been written about Berkshire Hathaway’s architects, but Alex’s stands out for its clarity. He distills decades of Buffett and Munger’s wisdom into something timeless. “Optimism without discipline is dangerous,” Alex says. “But discipline without optimism is paralyzing. Buffett and Munger managed to hold both.”

I think they’re better in every way because you get all of the soft, cheesy filling, none of the pasta fuss that can feel leaden together. Typically, gnudi are made with fresh greens that have been blanched and finely chopped but I’ve been on a mission over the last year to give frozen spinach (reliable! economical! seasonless!) more love, especially when all I’d planned to do with the fresh stuff was cook it down and feel bereft when it vanished. Frozen spinach saves me this heartache, and here we’re using a whole box, saving us a math headache too.

Officials had even grander hopes for the descendants of those rockets. They were planned to be mules for a permanent lunar base by 1981, propulsion systems for deep space probes to Jupiter, Saturn, and the outer planets, and engines for “space tugs” and shuttles ferrying payloads and people from low Earth orbit (LEO) to space stations around the Earth and the Moon.

We’re talking about all the evolutionary quirks that humans tend to exploit — the cases where we’re “built” for one purpose, but decide to put that structure to other uses. And masturbation is a classic example.
In this week’s Mini Philosophy interview, I spoke with Slingerland about his book Drunk, in which he outlines his “intoxication thesis.” Slingerland argues it’s quite common to think that getting drunk is an evolutionary mistake. Some early Homo sapiens drank too much fermented fruit juice and discovered it was pretty fun. So they told their mates and, altogether, they clinked their frothy ciders and sang bawdy songs about hunting and gathering. But the human brain and body were not built to get drunk. …]]></summary>

Neuroscientist Carl Hart, PhD, journalist Charles Duhigg, and psychologist Adam Alter, PhD explain how your brain wires habits as cue-routine-reward loops that control nearly half of your daily life. They show why willpower alone rarely works, why technology fuels new forms of addiction, and why habits can only be replaced, not erased.

A combination of increasing populations, the widespread development of heating and cooling, a reliance on modern electronics, and the introduction of new energy-intensive technologies (such as the blockchain, smart technology, and artificial intelligence) are among the factors driving our rising energy needs. Sure, we can always build more power plants, but what about the simple solution of increasing the efficiency and production of already-existing plants, particularly the ones that only see part-time usage: wind and solar. Wind power doesn’t work when the air is still, and solar doesn’t work during the night.

Pushing her coffee table to the wall and stacking the chairs, she cleared the center of her apartment as much as possible. Talos would just have to do its best to map whatever debris was left into the visualization.

While the museum boasts one of the greatest collections of art in the world, the main attraction for many people (including me on my first-ever trip abroad) is the Sistine Chapel, with its massive ceiling frescoes painted by Michelangelo at the start of the 16th century.
Getting into the chapel, though, requires a substantial time commitment. The relatively low entrance price of twenty euros means that many more people want to see the chapel than the 5,800 square feet (or 540 square meters) of space can accommodate. If you have not pre-purchased premium tickets to enter the museum, you must wait in a physical line to buy one. That wait…]]></summary>

The scariest part of The Wicker Man isn’t its eponymous effigy; it’s realizing what the natives of Summerisle will do to placate their gods. And while the ghosts haunting the Overlook Hotel may unnerve readers of The Shining, it is Jack Torrance’s maniacal relapse that truly grips the spine.
Tales that rely on cheap tricks can be fun, but the ones that exhume their horrors from within powerful ideas endure.
For that reason, we’re taking a look at five horror stories that double as philosophy lessons. Each one rests on a foundation of great ideas that can wrap around your mind like a tentacle and force you to really think about what has frightened you.

If the Universe was expanding today, that implies it was smaller — and hotter, and denser, and more uniform — in the past, leading to the idea of the hot Big Bang. Starting in the 1960s, the Big Bang’s greatest predictions were confirmed, leading to widespread acceptance of the theory. However, a few unexplained puzzles remained, leading scientists to question whether the most extreme predictions of the Big Bang, including arbitrarily high temperatures and an origin from a singularity, were actually correct.

When Steve Jobs opened Macworld on January 9, 2001, he boasted that in addition to the live audience in San Francisco, “we're streaming all the way up to a megabit per second all around the world.” Although he only mentioned streaming a couple more times during the event, it was a hint of what was to come.
At around the 40-minute mark, Jobs began talking about what Apple’s vision was in 2001, especially now that the economy was mired in a post-dot-com depression. He referenced some media reports that the PC had become boring and that its impact was waning. He talked about two “golden ages” for the PC: from 1980-1994, based around productivity applications, and 1995-2000, “the age of the Internet…]]></summary>

Baylor professor of psychology and neuroscience Sarah Schnitker explores how practicing gratitude can lead to stronger relationships and greater well-being. Her lab found that gratitude expressed through prayer may offer even more benefits than journaling or speaking it aloud, and that feeling connected to something larger may help combat today’s growing loneliness.

This comet, imaged in 2015 and known as C/2014 Q2 Lovejoy, brightened sufficiently to become as bright as magnitude +4: visible to the naked human eye even under fairly light-polluted conditions. When Comet Halley returns, it will only be about 5-6 times brighter than this, but when Comet Swift-Tuttle next returns, it will be about 20 times brighter. Swift-Tuttle is far more massive and dangerous than the other known periodic comets. Although comets have been recorded for thousands of years, their periodic nature was only uncovered in the 18th century, by Edmond Halley.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s no secret that the Universe and the objects present within it, as we see them all today, have changed over time as the Universe has grown up over the past 13.8 billion years. Galaxies are larger, more massive, more evolved, and are richer in stars but fewer in number than they were back in the early stages of cosmic history. By looking farther and farther away, we can see the Universe as it was at earlier times, but we’re going to be limited in many ways: by how deep our telescopes can see, by what wavelengths they’re capable of seeing, and by what small fraction of the sky they’re capable of observing.



That’s why an observing program like COSMOS-Web, the largest, widest-field JWST observing program to date, is so important. It isn’t just revealing galaxies as they are nearby (at late times), at a variety of intermediate distances (and earlier times), and at ultra-large distances (and the earliest times of all), but due to its wide-field nature, is revealing galaxy types of varying abundances: the common-type galaxies, galaxies that are representative of more uncommon varieties, and even significant numbers of rare galaxies. And it’s this aspect of galaxy evolution that makes me so proud and lucky to welcome Dr. Olivia Cooper to the podcast.



Olivia is a recently-minted PhD who works as part of the COSMOS-Web team, specializing in galaxy evolution and using JWST data — along with data from other world-class observatories — to investigate how the galaxies in our Universe grew up, and what that can teach us about our own cosmic past. It truly is a banger of an episode that you’ll want to listen to every minute of, so tune in and dive deep into the depths of the distant Universe on our latest adventure of the Starts With A Bang podcast!

This year, I bought three oval platters: a small, silver-plated one from a local charity shop on which I serve crisps to make them look fancy; a medium-sized splattered enamel one for everyday everything; and a very large, stainless-steel one for dinner parties. I’m not sure why this happened, but I can tell you that I love the energy that platters give to a table, and the gentle sense of pomp and ceremony they lend even the simplest of meals. My love for the platter has dictated today’s recipe, a final fling with the very last of the summer vegetables served over whipped feta.

Jefferson couldn’t disagree more with the sentiment. Convinced that American democracy would survive only if the government could be repaired and updated, he and the other Founding Fathers made sure the Constitution came with a built-in provision for amending its own contents.

conventional stars burning through their fuel with their own fully-formed planetary systems,

This graph maps those differences out into more specific categories, bringing blink-of-an-eye clarity to a complex topic. But it does not show changes over time. And those changes add critical context.

The graph is based on the third of Pew Research Center’s Religious Landscape Studies. Taken together, they reveal a dramatic drop in the number of Americans self-identifying as Christian: from 78% in 2007, 71% in 2014, and down to 63% in its latest survey (2023-24).
That last figure, however, seems to be holding steady since 2019. In other words, the decline of Christianity in America appears to have stabilized. Here’…]]></summary>

When faced with a difficult problem — and how to spend money in a way that will improve your life certainly is — it can help to work backward, reducing and excluding what doesn’t work until what’s left over is a decent approximation of favorable traits. Evolution works in similar ways, so thoroughly destroying what doesn’t work that what’s left over tends to work quite well. Or think about health: What foods are good for you is an endless debate, and no one who’s honest with the evidence can say they know the perfect diet. But what’s bad for you is much more settled.

In Lisbon, the former Portuguese finance minister Paulo Portas put it bluntly: “If Europe doesn’t innovate, it will become the museum of the world.”
This week’s Noema essay by Nathan Gardels captures that tension perfectly — the growing divide between America’s accelerationism and Europe’s caution. In the U.S., billions are pouring into AI infrastructure; in Europe, the focus remains on ethics, transparency, and control.
Gardels argues that both approaches are necessary: America’s restless innovation pushes humanity forward, while Europe’s restraint ensures progress remains humane. “AI differs from nuclear weapons because it is a foundational technol…]]></summary>

With its giant system of rings, Saturn’s appearance is immediately discernible, setting it apart from all the other known planets. First observed as “ears” by Galileo in 1609, a sharper view reveals that Saturn doesn’t have a shape like an amphibian’s eyes, but rather an expansive set of rings, detached and separated from the planet it surrounds. Over time, gaps, moons, moonlets, and a plethora of other features have been found above, below, inside, outside, and even within Saturn’s rings.
None of the rocky planets, asteroids, or known Kuiper belt objects have a system of rings. Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune possess them, but they’re all…]]></summary>

Rather than treating panic as a flaw, the actor argues it can be redirected into focus and authenticity.

Most of what we feed into AI has been made by a human — human art, human text, human prompts. And so, it’s clear that AI will inherit the biases and prejudices of human intelligence. For example, a lot has been written about how “racist” and “sexist” AI is.

As we grow, our environments, experiences, and cultures shape both our understanding of the world and the way our brains develop. This is why language is so important: it gives us a tool for growth, thought, and cultural expansion. Daniel Dennett, PhD, Ethan Kross, PhD, and Agustín Fuentes, PhD explain how belief, language, inner chatter, and rituals work together to make us distinctively human.
We created this video for Brain Briefs, a Big Think interview series created in partnership with Unlikely Collaborators.

Things are a little different in the quantum world, however. If you fire a subatomic particle, like an electron, at a barrier — whether that’s a solid barrier made of atoms or merely an energy barrier, where the particle doesn’t have enough energy, itself, to get to the other side — most of the electrons will bounce back.

After the hype and fear of Y2K (a.k.a. the Millenium bug) quickly faded in January 2000, the internet continued its mostly joyful rise in the culture. Sure, the dot-com bubble got pricked in March and then slowly deflated, but the web itself didn't stop growing.
Over 2000, "the Net" became an even more colorful, and increasingly social, place to hang out. Animated Flash pages were everywhere, bloggers were discovering and connecting to each other, social news sites like Slashdot and MetaFilter were rising in prominence. So despite the flagging economy, creativity in web design plus community in blogs and social news came to define the year 2000.
The Web Keeps Growing, Even as the Bubble Bursts

IDC projects global spending will surpass half a trillion dollars within the next two years. Boardrooms are talking about it, tech vendors are promising it, and learning and development teams are feeling the pressure to show they’re ‘doing something with AI.’
And yet, the results are almost invisible. MIT recently reported that 95 percent of AI projects fail to deliver measurable outcomes. Despite the unprecedented investment, productivity gains are elusive, employee adoption is shaky, and the business case often collapses under scrutiny.
How can we surround ourselves with the most powerful technology in human history, spend billions deploying it, and still struggle to prove it makes us better? The answer isn’t…]]></summary>

From the beginning, I’ve admired his work — his writing, his investment research, and perhaps most of all, his ability to stay relentlessly focused in a field that too often rewards distraction. Alex has always struck me as someone who plays the long game: careful in his thinking, measured in his conclusions, and deeply committed to extracting durable lessons from markets.
That’s why I was thrilled when he set out to write a book, Buffett and Munger Unscripted, about Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, arguably the two greatest investors of our time.
Plenty of books have been written about them — volumes on their deals, their financial acumen, even their quirks of personality. But Alex’s approach is different. Rather than layering on his own theo…]]></summary>

Some industry experts who have spent years tackling seemingly insurmountable problems are beginning to see real promise in using generative AI for content moderation.

The train was powered by steam, and the trip took four days and nights, winding through the hills and small mountains. 
The China I saw out of that train’s window was the same one a traveler could have seen 100 or more years prior. At the time of my visit, China was a nation of close to a billion rural peasants living in small villages and mostly growing rice in paddies as far as you could see. For an American like me, it was like traveling back in time.

You can imagine how you might feel and what you might do, but you can never actually know how you will respond in a situation until it happens. Falling in love, becoming a parent, and facing one’s mortality all fit into this category. In the workplace, your first interview, first day on the job, and the first time you’re given the responsibility of managing others fall into this category. For a select few who successfully climb the corporate ladder, becoming CEO also lands there. Oliver Bäte, CEO of European financial services company Allianz, puts it starkly: “You don’t really know what happens on the job until the day you have it.”

The second is the Opera Cake (Gâteau Opéra), a stacked and striped dessert with thin almond cake layers soaked in espresso syrup, chocolate ganache, and a rich espresso buttercream. The difference between the first cake and the second is that the second recipe was never going to happen.

In the nearly two decades of Smitten Kitchen’s existence, I’ve again and again begun researching what a homemade opera cake would entail and every time, slammed the proverbial book shut because it was just too much. A joconde! French buttercream! Soaking syrup! Chocolate layer! Many separated eggs! And what about all of that espresso? There are children present! And elderly people (me) who probably shouldn’t drink coffee after 4pm! If I could barely talk myself into it, how would I convince you? Maybe some things are best left to the professionals, I concluded.

At one point, Andrew Gazdecki belonged to the second of these two cohorts. “I held on because I was attached,” he says of his first company, Bizness Apps, which he sold in 2017. The company, a publishing platform that helps businesses develop mobile apps, began life in 2010, riding the smartphone revolution kickstarted by Apple. When, years later, Bizness Apps began losing customers, and continued losing customers, part of Gazdecki knew it was time to sell. And yet he waited.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Historian and free speech advocate Jacob Mchangama explains how suppressing voices often has the opposite effect. From the crucifixion of Jesus fueling Christianity to Barbra Streisand accidentally amplifying photos of her Malibu mansion, attempts at censorship often strengthen what they aim to silence. Mchangama argues that while free speech can be messy and ugly, it remains essential to preserve its many benefits.

This highly unusual object was spotted with JWST: a background spiral galaxy heavily distorted by the gravitational lensing effects of a foreground elliptical galaxy. This data was part of the Strong Lensing and Cluster Evolution (SLICE) survey, which targets galaxy cluster evolution; an independent complement to the gravitational lenses found as part of the wider-field COSMOS-Web survey.

The stars, shining brightly throughout the sky, will all someday burn out; the galaxies will someday turn dark. Even if the timescales for some of these phenomena are barely fathomable to the human mind, the fact remains that everything within the Universe, and even the Universe itself, will someday cease to exist as we know it.

Case in point: a few weeks ago, Dr. Susan Schneider — the philosopher, author, and cognitive scientist — emailed me in response to a recent newsletter I had written. Her message turned into a phone call, which then developed into a deep and unexpected exchange about the real risks of AI.
Susan and I ended up shaping that conversation into a recent Long Game column for Big Think, where Susan introduced me to some of her latest work, focusing on the “megasystem problem”: networks of AI systems colluding in ways we can’t anticipate. Her perspective is fascinating, and it’s exactly the kind of conversation I hope this newsletter continues to spark.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you view anything at all in the Universe, you’re not seeing it precisely as it is right now: at the moment you experience seeing it. The speed of light, even though it’s the fastest speed that any signal can travel throughout the Universe, is still finite. No matter how close or distant an object is, you’re only seeing it as it was a particular amount of time ago: at the moment the now-arriving light was emitted from the object you’re observing. The fact that light has to travel through space, from the emitted object to the observer that sees it, explains why there’s a gap that we have to fill in through inference alone.
Every observer in the Universe, so long as they haven’t spent a large amount of time traveling close to the speed of light (or in an extraordinarily large gravitation…]]></summary>

I’m calling this activity “replanting” — because it feels like moving a neglected plant, perhaps crowded by weeds and eaten by bugs, into a new garden, where it will be cared for and nurtured again.
Of course, I’m borrowing from the digital garden approach to personal publishing advocated by Maggie Appleton and others.  Maggie even uses the term “plant” to mean posting an item (and “tend” to edit). That’s probably where the similarities end, because Maggie defines a digital garden as a collection of notes — “evolving ideas that aren’t st…]]></summary>

Sometimes, you can be talking to someone for hours, and it feels like only a few minutes. You natter and natter without ever having to think of what to say or cringe through any awkward silence. There’s a gentle sway to things — you listen, they speak, they listen, you speak. The chat dances to the easy and comfortable rhythm of the conversational tide.
At other times, a conversation can feel like medieval torture. One-word answers litter the path toward your desperate, fumbling attempt to get away. You’ve already used the toilet excuse, you’ve got a full drink, so you’re stuck in your chatless hell with Captain Boring.
“So, how often do you feed your dog?” you ask.
“It depends.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sleep helps us recharge, but research suggests its impact is far larger than recharging our physical and mental batteries. 
According to Patrick McNamara PhD, Shelby Harris PsyD, DBSM, and Dave Asprey, sleep is imperative to restoring cells, regulating metabolism, consolidating memory, and synchronizing the body’s internal clocks. REM in particular aided human cultural evolution, allowing our ancestors to make creative leaps by connecting disparate ideas. With this powerful ability, humanity was able to advance past lives of pure survival and into ones filled with art, science, and culture.

send orbiting missions directly to the outer planets,

The other company, Softbank, was a renowned investment bank.

Philosopher Will Buckingham once remarked that, if reasoned dialogue worked as we might expect, philosophers would be shifting their views “with a quicksilver frequency that would put the rest of us to shame.” After all, in a world teeming with critical colleagues and formidable counterarguments, one might imagine minds constantly turning over.

Even something as simple as adding evidence from employee poll results to support some aspect of the change would help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here on planet Earth, everything that we see, feel, or interact with is composed of atoms. There are approximately 90 naturally occurring species of atom that we can find on Earth, and approximately 30 more that we can synthesize under laboratory conditions. We’ve learned, thanks to the power of modern science, that atoms themselves are not fundamental, but rather can be divided into smaller chunks: electrons and an atomic nucleus, where the nucleus in turn can be further decomposed into protons and neutrons, which themselves are each made up of quarks and gluons. Only when we reach that deep of a level — the level of electrons, quarks, and gluons — do we encounter particles that are truly fundamental.
But the word atom itself, derived from the Greek word ατομός, literally means uncuttable…]]></summary>

When I left a big tech job, I threw myself straight into a startup. I rushed into new relationships after breakups, or into the next project as soon as the previous one ended.
I’ve often filled the gaps too quickly, because the in-between felt impossible to sit with. And I know I’m not the only one.
Maybe you just left a job without knowing what’s next. Maybe you’ve left a job without knowing what’s next, moved to a new city, or found yourself in that strange territory after a relationship ends.
These moments are destabilizing. You’re standing in the hallway between who you were and who you’re becoming. Your brain screams for certainty, for solid ground,…]]></summary>

Built of metal cabinets packed with 17,468 vacuum tubes (descendants of the lightbulb that would, in later decades, be superseded by transistors), it could dash through five-thousand additions a second — at the cost of enough kilowatts to power your modern household for three years.

If we reframe loneliness as an opportunity instead of a threat, it can have surprising benefits for our creativity, well-being, and relationships with ourselves.

A period of cosmic inflation stretched space flat, seeding the Universe with quantum fluctuations.

From a region of space as small as can be imagined (all the way down to the Planck scale), cosmological inflation causes space to expand exponentially: relentlessly doubling and doubling again with each tiny fraction-of-a-second that elapses. Although this empties the Universe and stretches it flat, it also contains quantum fluctuations superimposed atop it: fluctuations that will later provide the seeds for cosmic structure within our own Universe. What happened before the final ~10^-32 seconds of inflation, including the question of whether inflation arose from a singular state before it, not only isn’t known, but may…]]></summary>

A little joyful nugget that could be taken in any direction, from Swedish köttbullar to Vietnamese bun cha.

These stretched light waves are a consequence of the expanding Universe, and they are nearly, but not quite, identical for galaxies that we see in all directions in space.
Does that difference, and the fact that one direction has a slightly greater redshift for its objects than the opposite direction, tell us anything about where, all those billions of years ago, the Big Bang actu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My earliest lessons in observation came not from a laboratory but in the living room, with my father in his tuxedo and top hat. To everyone else, he was “Big Ed,” a larger-than-life physician who was a magician, an archer, a raconteur, and much else. By day, he mesmerized patients with his easy confidence; by night, he dazzled guests with sleight-of-hand, conjuring coins from behind ears or producing endless scarves from his sleeve. To me, he was both healer and illusionist, a scientist and showman.
When your father is a magician, what do you believe? As a child, the boundary between real and unreal was porous. I wanted to believe in the rabbit pulled from a hat, the floating light bulb, the miraculous escapes. But even as a boy, I began to notice the seams: the telltale flash of a hidden …]]></summary>

On his popular YouTube channel, Cool Worlds, Kipping takes viewers on in-depth explorations of subjects like planetary systems, interstellar travel, and the search for life beyond Earth.
I first met Kipping at the famous 2018 NASA technosignature meeting in Houston, where the space agency first indicated they would be open to funding work on intelligent life in the Universe. As we are both astrophysicists and science communicators, I wanted to discuss Kipping’s journey from a young stargazer to a Columbia professor, his work on life in the Universe, and the challenges of explaining science in the YouTube era.

It is a tale of two rulers and some hippos during one of the fragmented ‘Intermediate Periods’ (mid-second millennium BCE). One ruler was Apepi of the foreign Hyksos 15th Dynasty, at that time based in the delta city of Avaris. The other was Seqenenra Taa II, ruler of the simultaneous and rival 17th Dynasty, based down in Thebes. One day, Apepi sent a messenger south to Thebes to convey a complaint and an instruction to Seqenenra. 
Apepi claimed that he was being kept awake at night by ‘the hippopotami from the swamp … in the eastern waters of the city [of Thebes], because they do not allow that sleep come to me, day or night, because their noise is in his ear!’ Seqenenra…]]></summary>

Existentialism is often represented by Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, while absurdism is often represented by Albert Camus. All were French intellectuals active in the decades following World War II, and they knew one another. They drank, they danced, and they laughed together. But absurdism and existentialism are not the same.
In this week’s Mini Philosophy interview, I spoke with the philosopher and writer Laura Kennedy about Camus. Camus is often misidentified as an existentialist, and he is even on record as saying he was not one. In fact, as the years went on, the relationship between Sartre and Camus got frostier and frostier. So, behind the bitter op-eds and vi…]]></summary>

After Williams, Jeff went on to Oxford, Cambridge, and then earned his PhD in philosophy at Berkeley, so it’s no surprise he now makes his living persuading people with reasoning. (I just wish he’d go easier on me at dinner parties.)
His speech, which I encourage you to watch, was classic Jeff: gripping, funny, and deeply thoughtful.

As we see the Universe today, it appears full of stuff: matter, radiation, antimatter, neutrinos, and even dark matter and dark energy, despite the fact that we don’t truly know the ultimate, fundamental nature of the latter two. Yet even if you took away every single quantum of energy, somehow removing it from the Universe entirely, you wouldn’t be left with an empty Universe. No matter how much you take out of it, the Universe will always generate new forms of energy.
How is this possible? It’s like the Universe itself doesn’t understand our idea of “nothing” at all; if we were to remove all the quanta of energy from our Universe, leaving behind only empty space, we woul…]]></summary>

If the Universe is expanding and cooling today, that implies a past that was smaller, denser, and hotter. In our imaginations, we can extrapolate back to arbitrarily small sizes, high densities, and hot temperatures: all the way to a singularity, where all of the Universe’s matter and energy was condensed in a single point. For many decades, these two notions of the Big Bang — of the hot dense state that describes the early Universe and the initial singularity — were inseparable.
But beginning in the 1970s, scientists started identifying some puzzles surrounding the Big Bang, noting several properties of the Universe that weren’t explainable within the context of these two no…]]></summary>

For the first several months of 2000, David Bowie’s website was a work in progress. BowieNet was undergoing a redesign, which had originally been scheduled to go-live at the end of January. But like many other software projects before and since, it got delayed. Finally, in May, the new version of BowieNet was launched.
“There are some exciting and great new features including new 'points' system accumulator, new message boards, Beatnik enhanced pages [an interactive audio technology], web based email for all members, 10 meg of free web space, your personal profile, [and] your own account section,” wrote Paul Kinder on his fan site BowieWonderworld.

Dr. Susan Schneider calls this the “megasystem problem”: networks of AI models colluding in ways we can’t predict, producing emergent structures beyond human control. It’s also something she believes is one of the most urgent — and overlooked — risks we face today with AI today.
Schneider has been thinking about these questions long before ChatGPT or Claude became household names. She is a professor and the Founding Director of the Center for the Future Mind at Florida Atlantic University’s Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute. Her career has spanned philosophy, neuroscience, and cognitive science.

In word associations, the two words usually belong to the same semantic category but are set off by a salient contrast (night–day, girl–boy, dog–cat). Like laughter, tears express an emotional state by means other than the muscles of the face. They are involuntary, conspicuous to a perceiver, and unique to Homo sapiens (a conclusion flaunted in the title of the most comprehensive book on the subject, the psychologist Ad Vingerhoets’s Why Only Humans Weep). And they seem engineered to generate common knowledge. A weeping person feels the welling in his sockets and the trickle on his cheeks and sees a blurry world through his own tears, a world that contains other people seeing the same tears from the outsid…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When companies refer to “PR,” they often mean the function that drives buzz for the business by getting headlines. Many founders assume that hiring a public relations firm (or an on-staff PR lead) will quickly get them regular, glowing write-ups in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, which they can then share with their target audiences on Facebook or LinkedIn to drive demand and generate leads. Or better yet, they might get physical press clippings, which are a nice ego boost, even though fewer and fewer people read printed newspapers and magazines. These clips can be framed to adorn office hallways or sent to family members to stick on the fridge.
This way of thinking, however, leads companies to take a very hands-off approach to press coverage. As I’ve seen it done for years…]]></summary>

Whenever our prevailing picture of reality — including the rules it plays by, the physical contents of a system, and how it evolved from its initial conditions to the present time — gets challenged by new experimental or observational data, we must open our minds to changing our conceptual picture of the cosmos. This has happened many times since the dawn of the 20th century, and the words we use to describe our Universe have shifted in meaning as our understanding has evolved.
Yet, there are always those who cling to the old definitions, much like linguistic prescriptivists, who refuse to acknowledge that these changes have occurred. Bu…]]></summary>

By the time you ask this question, it’s already too late. Exit interviews might surface useful insights, but they can’t undo the fact that employees are already walking out the door. Even stay interviews—meant to get ahead of problems—become a box-checking exercise, more about HR optics than improving the workplace.
In tough economic times, employee experience tends to take a backseat to productivity. Companies slip into old habits, reducing workforce investments and pushing people to “do more with less.” After all, employees should just be grateful to have jobs, right? People end up tolerating less-than-great environments to keep their paychecks. It’s an unfortunate cycle that keeps repeating.

Even as a child, Gall was fascinated by the brain and its connection with people’s personalities, and so throughout his career, he intensely studied its anatomy while also gathering data on people’s skull sizes and facial features.
He came to believe that people’s mental faculties were localized within specific brain regions. And because these regions molded the shape of people’s skulls, a trained eye could divinate a person’s capabilities for love, violence, greed, intelligence, and other traits simply by examining their cranial bumps and recessions.
As you’ve probably guessed, Gall’s hypotheses provided the basis for phrenology — though Ga…]]></summary>

Instead of solving problems, high conflict traps us in a cycle where arguments feed on themselves, eroding trust and entire relationships. So, why are we so susceptible to it? Ripley explains, sharing our psychological tripwires and how to avoid them.

Most often, the one question all people know to ask is whether or not that paper has successfully passed peer review or not. If it hasn’t, people often dismiss the work, noting that we should remain skeptical because it hasn’t yet been vetted by anyone else with the appropriate expertise. But if it has passed peer review, people often assume that means everything that’s written in the paper — the methods of the study, the analysis performed, the results obtained, the conclusions drawn, and other assertions that the authors might make — must be correct.

Some teachers did so with the grudging monotone of the forced and underpaid employee. Some did it with the exhausting energy of a fanatic. Ms. Vasey, the physics teacher, even dressed up as the solar system. But Mr. Smith decided to win us over with the cold, lofty logic of an Oxford graduate.

Your job is to go out of the office, talk to people, travel the world, and try to understand where the future might be headed — so you can place your bets accordingly.
In that spirit, my colleague Daniel Crowley, CFA, wrote about the two weeks he spent in China this summer. Dan visited electric car companies, cruised through Macau, immersed himself in a humanoid robotics conference (where he saw an android dog with a fake machine gun strapped to its back!) and much more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the first theorems anyone learns in mathematics is the Pythagorean Theorem: if you have a right triangle, then the square of the longest side (the hypotenuse) will always equal the sums of the squares of the other two sides. The first integer combination that this works for is a triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5: 3² + 4² = 5². There are other combinations of numbers that this works for, too, including:
5, 12, and 13,
6, 8, and 10,
7, 24 and 25,
and infinitely more. But 3, 4, and 5 are special: they’re the only consecutive whole numbers that obey the Pythagorean Theorem. In fact, the numbers 3, 4, and 5 are the only consecutive whole numbers that allow you to solve the equation a² + b² = c² at all!
However, if you allowed yourself the freedom to include more numbers, you could imagine …]]></summary>

Cool, you say. But, really, what does that mean? How much closer does it get us to discovering life beyond Earth?
Some findings are, of course, more significant than others, and in fact do get us closer to that long-hoped-for announcement. First, though, we have to understand all the ways that nature — especially Martian nature — might deceive us.

Three experts, Aditi Nerurkar, MD, MPH, Kelly McGonigal, PhD, and Jon Kabat-Zinn, PhD combine their insights on physiology, psychology, and mindfulness to show how stress management can become a superpower. They explain how stress can help you grow, how the body’s “challenge response” fuels focus and energy, and how mindfulness can help you see beyond your thoughts.
We created this video for Brain Briefs, a Big Think interview series created in partnership with Unlikely Collaborators. As a creative non-profit organization, they’re on a mission to help people challenge their perceptions and expand their thinking.

From across the Universe, a black hole of 36 times the mass of the Sun merged with another of 29 times the Sun’s mass, producing a remnant black hole of just 62 solar masses, with the other 3 solar masses getting converted into gravitational radiation via Einstein’s E = mc².
When those emitted waves arrived in each of the twin LIGO detectors, they changed the length of LIGO’s incredibly long, precise laser arms by less than the width of a single proton. Yet …]]></summary>

By the start of 2000, blogging was becoming a communal activity. One of its pioneers, Cameron Barrett, had a “Sites I Visit Often” list in his sidebar that had gotten longer over the past year and now included many weblogs. Although there wasn’t a word for this kind of list at the time, it would eventually become known as a “blogroll” (the earliest reference to this term I could find was Doc Searls in December 2000, who used the word “blogrolling” as a subheader).

But it had downsides as well. It also accelerated the spread of what you could reasonably politely call propaganda and what you could less politely call manipulative, destructive lies. Also, the spread of knowledge had unanticipated knock-on effects.
The Catholic Church was thrilled with the power of the press when the innovation helped raise cash for the Church’s crusades and get more Bibles into the hands of more people. Perhaps it was less thrilled when the press provided propaganda for both sides in Mainz’s 1462 civil war. And, of course, many Church leaders likely cursed the technology the Church had helped create when rapid printing hastened Martin Luth…]]></summary>

This was caused by the NASA spacecraft Osiris-Rex, which collected the resulting dust and returned those samples to Earth, marking the first time a U.S. mission had retrieved material from an asteroid. 
Earlier this year, researchers found those samples contained the building blocks for life, including amino acids and nucleobases (which form DNA, among other molecules). That’s not unusual for an asteroid, but what was unexpected was the form those molecules took: roughly half of them being a perfect inverse — a mirror image — of the way those building blocks appear on Earth.
This was interesting timing. Only a few months prior, toward the end of 2024, a te…]]></summary>

First developed by business theorist Alex Osterwalder and computer scientist Yves Pigneur in the early 2000s as part of Osterwalder’s PhD thesis, the BMC framework has since developed into one of the most well-known and widely used business modeling tools on the planet, embedding itself in MBA curricula and guiding decision-making processes in C-suites and incubators alike.

The rock shown here, discovered by NASA’s Perseverance Rover on Mars, contains leopard-like spots on a reddish rock located in Mars’s Jezero Crater in July of 2024. Sample analysis indicated organic molecules and reduction/oxidation reactions, which could serve as a potential biosignature. However, abiotic pathways to the production of these characteristics cannot be ruled out as of yet.

The spinach and feta pie, AKA spanakopita, on which this recipe is based is deeply rooted in Greek culinary history. So I probably shouldn’t have messed with it, but I did, because I’m a tinkerer. I wanted a lot of spring onions, you see, because, together, cooked green onions and spinach are a bittersweet fantastic dream, especially when they’re tempered with some creamy ricotta. But then, to stop it from getting too sleepy, I escalated the fresh herbs, kept the sharp feta (I’m not a monster) and finished it with a fresh lemon and pine nut salsa. Same same, but actually quite a bit different.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you want to see the Universe, you have to do more than merely open your eyes. Even with the advantage of large, powerful telescopes, even from far above the limitations of Earth’s atmosphere in space, there are still enormous portions of the Universe that are virtually invisible to our optical telescopes. The reason why? Because enormous portions of the Universe are blocked by cosmic dust: small, cold grains of atom-based matter that absorb and block the visible wavelengths of light that human eyes have adapted to see. They obscure enormous regions of the galactic plane, and hinder our ability to observe star-forming regions, planet-forming disks, and objects that lie behind and beyond the plane of the Milky Way.
Sure, we’ve developed many techniques, like multi-wavelength astronomy (pa…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 2009 documentary Transcendent Man, the American inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil shares his thoughts on death. Although many philosophers and theologians accept mortality as an inevitable and indeed defining feature of human existence, Kurzweil refuses to accept this line of thinking. “Death is a great tragedy, a profound loss,” he declares in the film, haunted by the memory of losing his father at age 22. “I don’t accept it.”
Kurzweil would have found an ally in the little-known 19th-century Russian philosopher Nikolai Fedorov, whose posthumously published text Philosophy of the Common Task made the at-the-time daring argument that death was little more than a design flaw — one which advancements in science and technology could help to rectify. Fedorov also believed that this goa…]]></summary>

I’ve been revisiting this quote lately because, in many ways, I feel Western democracies have gone fully through the looking glass when it comes to how we discuss politics.
The words we use to describe our positions and those of others often sit on shaky perches. They shift — not just in implication but sometimes even definitionally — based on the context, speaker, and audience, leaving us without a clear sense of what people mean. And perhaps no other word in politics today sits on a shakier perch than liberalism.
Consider that in the United States, a liberal is someone who stands on the political left, probably voted for Joe Biden, a…]]></summary>

My attention ping-ponged. The article deadline that felt manageable yesterday now loomed. The client presentation that should take an hour felt like it would consume my entire weekend. Even checking email felt like wading into a swamp.

AI can radically simplify our lives (and I use it often), yet at the same time, it threatens to erode the very foundation of trust — trust in information, trust in institutions, and even trust in one another.
In the knowledge work age, your value was often measured by your IQ. But as Kevin Kelly argues, in the age of AI, the more critical metric is shifting. What matters most is no longer just intelligence, but what he calls the Trust Quotient — the ability to be authentic and develop trust in a world where machines can imitate almost everything else.

Our Universe may be full of stars, galaxies, and a cosmic web of large-scale structure, all separated by the vastness of empty space between them, but it wasn’t born that way. It’s a profound realization that our cosmos hasn’t existed in its current form forever. Instead, the Universe came to be this way because it expanded and cooled from a hot, dense, uniform, matter-and-radiation-filled state with no galaxies, stars, or even simple atoms present at the outset.

The airport is a bustling, heaving business, and the kids fight over the window seat. And it’s downhill from there. The beaches are so busy that they cannot find a spot big enough for them all. The mountain bike trails are a muddy churn with hour-long queues at the top. The amusement park is more expensive than the flights. And, to top it all off, it’s col…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Once upon a time — not so long ago — the internet opened like a library with no closing hours. It offered us Google, and then Wikipedia, and with them a curious kind of magic: everything we ever wanted to know, right there, blinking in front of us. It was harmless enough, even liberating. We no longer had to argue about who directed Casablanca or the difference between a quark and a lepton. Answers flowed like tap water.
But something happened in that flood. We began mistaking the map for the terrain.
Not long after came the shortcuts — CliffsNotes for Shakespeare, then for Kant, then for life itself. Everything abstract or difficult was carved into quick summaries, punchy headlines, 30-second reels. Learning became a buffet of “life hacks,” each one promising to make you smarter, faster, …]]></summary>

He challenges “naive realism,” showing how reality is filtered through our senses and shaped by culture, bias, and brain wiring. Using examples like the viral 2015 ‘Gold Dress’ phenomenon and his own experience with meditation, Koch explains how expanding our Perception Box fosters empathy, openness, and a deeper sense of belonging in the world.

Tyler Volk, PhD, Bruce Greyson, MD, and BJ Miller, MD, have studied death from the perspective of biology, psychiatry, and palliative care, and together they reveal that it’s far more than a clinical endpoint. According to them, it’s time to change how we understand mortality, seeing it as both central to evolution and something to be reclaimed from medicine’s grip.

When we thought about finding an inhabited world out there in the Milky Way, we had only the worlds of our Solar System — Earth, Venus, Mars, Neptune, Titan, Pluto, Enceladus, Triton, and Jupiter’s moons — to consider as potential analogues. Now in 2025, however, we’re closing in on an incredible 6000 confirmed exoplanets, and we’ve learned that the most common type of world that we know of isn’t represented at all in our Solar System: a class of worlds known as super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. These exoplanets, often rich in atmospheric hazes, are the most abundant species of world known at present.

In the 16th century, the Polish astronomer Copernicus had argued that it was not the Earth, but the Sun that was at the center of the universe. In the 18th century, astronomers realized that this too was wrong. The Sun was but one star among many moving through that great assembly of stars we call the Milky Way. 
What’s more, many Enlightenment thinkers also suspected that the center of the cosmos was not even the Milky Way — they thought there were other galaxies in the depths of space. In the late-17th century, the French physicist and mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace summarized this new cosmic understanding when he wrote, “[M]an now appear…]]></summary>

Angus Fletcher’s Primal Intelligence is one of those books. Released in August, it has already become a national bestseller — and for good reason.
Fletcher is a rare hybrid: trained as both a neuroscientist and a professor of literature, he teaches at Ohio State’s Project Narrative, the world’s leading academic center for the study of story. His previous titles — Wonderworks and Storythinking — earned him a reputation as a boundary-breaking thinker who blends science, history, and art to explain why stories matter and how they shape human creativity.

Reality is a complicated place, and the only tools we have to guide us in understanding what it is and how it works is the combination of what we can observe, measure, and experiment on. When we add up the full suite of that body of observational and experimental knowledge, we have a record of all the phenomena that we know exists. The enterprise of science, then, seeks to make sense of all of it, and to explain it as simply and powerfully as possible: to maximize our predictive power of nature’s phenomena with as few assumptions, parameters, and variables as are absolutely necessary.

After starring on six seasons of MTV’s Run’s House — where viewers were invited inside the home of his father, ordained Pentecostal minister Reverend Run, an original member of hip-hop group Run-DMC — Simmons went on to found two companies: record label Whos House Entertainment, and 3isFor, a content strategy and media production firm focused on telling stories about mental health and personal growth.

He argues that today, tech platforms twist our view by promoting extremists for clicks, making it feel like free speech is the problem. But free speech only works if all voices are allowed. According to Mchangama,  it is silence that truly damages equality and democracy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s hard to believe, but it was only back in the early 1990s that we discovered the very first planet orbiting a star other than our own Sun. Fast forward to the present day, here in 2025, and we’re closing in on 6000 confirmed exoplanets, found and measured through multiple techinques: the transit method, the stellar wobble method, and even direct imaging. That last one is so profoundly exciting because it gives us hope that, someday soon, we might be able to take direct images of Earth-like worlds, some of which may even be inhabited.



Although it may be a long time before we can get an exoplanet image as high-resolution as even the ultra-distant “pale blue dot” photo that Voyager took of Earth so many decades ago, the fact remains that science is advancing rapidly, and things that seemed impossible mere decades ago now reflect today’s reality. And the people driving this fascinating field forward the most are the mostly unheralded workhorses of the fields of physics and astronomy: the early-career researchers, like grad students and postdocs, who are just beginning to establish themselves as scientists.



In this fascinating conversation with Dr. Kielan Hoch of Space Telescope Science Institute, we take a long walk at the current frontiers of science and peek over the horizon: looking at the good, the bad, and the ugly of what we’re facing here in 2025. It’s a conversation that might make you hopeful, angry, and optimistic all at the same time. After all, it’s your Universe too; don’t you want to know what comes next?

My grandmother, Narmada Lakhani, passed away earlier this year aged 92. Well, we think she was 92, but no one recorded her birth date, so we can only estimate. What we do know about her, though, is that she had a very cheeky laugh, and that she loved lager tops, penny slot machines and tucking £10 notes down her bra, ready to hand out to an unsuspecting grandchild as a gift. She never asked if I was happy, only if I’d eaten well, which I assume to her were the same thing. At this time of year, eating well for her meant tucking into sweetcorn, so, in her memory, I’m going to do the same.

About six million years ago, something caused the Mediterranean to be cut off. Perhaps it was an ice age that decreased the sea level enough to leave a land bridge between Spain and Morocco. The Mediterranean’s isolation could also have been the outcome of tectonic processes.

Host and investor John Candeto — whom you may remember from our Long Game discussion on power laws — pressed me on why I’ve been traveling the world to study companies that endure: from London’s Lloyd’s and Lock & Co., to Italy’s Riva, Beretta, and Giusti, to Japan’s Tsuen Tea and Hōshi Ryokan.
At the heart of it is this: for me, studying the past provides a living playbook for how to build systems that can withstand shocks and endure for generations. And the high-level pattern emerging across my research is clear: longevity comes from honoring tradition while evolving slowly, and centering trust with employees and communities.

The Sun, after all, produces its own light, sustainably powered by nuclear fusion in its core. That core-generated energy helps keep the Sun from contracting under its own gravitation, but also propagates to the Sun’s edge, the photosphere, where the Sun emits radiation over a wide range of wavelengths that correspond to a temperature of around 6000 K. Although the Moon is the second-brightest object in most wavelengths of light, it only appears so bright because of its very close proximity to Earth.

This thing will give me more satisfaction and pleasure than that thing.
The problem, though, is that weighing up pros and cons is not locked into the moment. The pleasure of an act might echo out into the future in happy, contented ripples.

the fact that it has the largest effect, of any planet, on the wobbling orbit of our parent star,
the fact that it’s well-separated from our parent star, making it an easier target for direct imaging than any of the rocky planets,

Meanwhile, the dot-com bubble continued to expand, with IPOs from Nvidia (now the world's most valuable company), Netscape co-founder Jim Clark's Healtheon, priceline.com, Ask Jeeves, Red Hat, TiVo, Akamai and others. Also, Google received its first VC funding round in June and declared its bold goal “to organize the world’s information, making it universally accessible and useful.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Bloom Books canceled the release of best-selling author Sophie Lark’s new romance novel, Sparrow and Vine. The decision came after advance copies met an online backlash regarding a character readers argued was racist, MAGA-coded, and fangirled over Elon Musk (persona non grata of the progressive left for, well, obvious reasons).
In response, Lark posted a statement on Instagram. While the statement has since been removed, according to reporting at the time, Lark apologized and promised to revisit the book “to ensure that [her] work doesn’t contribute to harm” and listen “more closely to our sensitivity readers” in the future. Though she added, her character was intended to be “flawed.”

began with a period of cosmic inflation that preceded and set up the hot Big Bang,
then the hot Big Bang occurred, creating a dense, hot, mostly uniform Universe,
containing normal matter and radiation, but dominated by dark matter and dark energy,
which gravitated, expanded, and cooled,
forming the light elements, neutral atoms, stars, galaxies, and black holes,

It might seem strange, but I’d just read an excerpt in history class, and it had sounded like perfect reading for any young person looking to make their way in the world. There’s a lot of pragmatic wisdom in The Prince, all focused on achieving significant leadership goals. However, as the critics of its time so succinctly put it, one key message of the book is that, when it comes to leadership, “the ends justify the means.” Although it is now often regarded as an outdated manual for acquiring and maintaining power, some of the utilitarian conclusions that Machiavelli draws are very similar to how outcome-oriented leaders rationalize their achievements…]]></summary>

Psychologist Sarah Schnitker explains why virtue grows best when rooted in purpose beyond the self. Through studies of marathon runners fundraising for clean water, she shows how pro-social and spiritual motivations—not just personal fitness goals—led to deeper growth in generosity, patience, and self-control.
This research challenges the idea that self-improvement alone leads to virtue. When moral purpose and shared meaning enter the picture, transformation becomes more than personal: it becomes relational and lasting.

The extent of the visible Universe now goes on for 46.1 billion light-years: the distance that light emitted at the instant of the Big Bang would be located from us today, after a 13.8 billion year journey. As time marches on, light that’s even farther away, that is still on its way to us, will eventually arrive: from slightly greater distances and with slightly greater redshifts. We see into the past when we look out to great distances because the light emitted from distant objects must traverse those great intergalactic distances at a finite speed: the speed of light.

It starts with seasoned sushi rice (which I could eat just by itself) and is topped with a variety of fun things to munch on such as salt- and lime-seasoned cabbage, edamame beans and glazed pieces of barbecued tempeh, all bound together with a gentle but perky sriracha sauce.

This last one is very disappointing to space enthusiasts, as it dooms their hopes of ever speedily exploring the cosmos. Space is vast, with the closest star located four light years away. Even a simple radio signal, which travels at the fastest speed possible, will take eight years to make a round trip.
The idea that there is a maximum speed is pretty counterintuitive; after all, in everyday experience, you can make a car go faster simply by stepping harder on the gas or upgrading to a sports car. In rocketry, you can just let the rocke…]]></summary>

Initially, Einstein introduced the notion of a cosmological constant — a form of energy inherent to the fabric of space itself — to prevent a matter-filled Universe from collapsing. When we discovered that the Universe was expanding, the constant disappeared, eventually leading Einstein to declare it his biggest blunder. Then in the 1990s, a surprising collection of data indicated that the Universe’s expansion was accelerating, a discovery that revived the cosmological constant. The combination of supernova, cosmic microwave background, and large-scale structure data all appeared to demand it.

On January 26, 1999, Cameron Barrett — who ran a website called Camworld — pondered the meaning of a new term he’d recently discovered:
“A few months back, I heard the term weblog for the first time. I'm not sure who coined it or where it came from, so I can't properly credit it. Typically, a weblog is a small web site, usually maintained by one person that is updated on a regular basis and has a high concentration of repeat visitors. Weblogs often are highly focused around a singular subject, an underlying theme or unifying concept.”

This is, nevertheless, a surprisingly tiny percentage of Earth history. For the first 90% of Earth history, the planet’s face was entirely untouched by flame. This is because it takes three things to make a fire.
The spark. For all of Earth history, lightning has been zapping the surface, today at the rate of 100 strikes a second. And for the entire history of fire on planet Earth, the vast majority of fires have been set by these bolts from the blue. Astoundingly, though, even at the rate of 100 strikes a second, human pyrophilia today far outpaces lightning, with 84% of the world’s blazes set by people (not counting the controlled fires in every fossil-fueled power plant, furnace, and engine on…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look around you right now. Stare at all the things nearby. These things will lovingly present you with what the psychologist James J. Gibson called an “ambient optic array” — the structured pattern of light reaching your eyes. Light reflects off surfaces, passes through the cornea and lens, and lands on the retina, where photons trigger the photoreceptors that kick off neural processing.
Of course, we do not see a world of individual photons. We see a world of meaningful things — things that we build with, cook with, play with, fight with, and use. Gibson argued that we see the world in terms of “affordances,” where we see objects as opportunities for action. We think, “What can I use this thing for?” and “What’s it good at?”

In a Noema essay, the forest ecologist and author Suzanne Simard explores how trees offer us a different kind of wisdom: they are part of a living intelligence, bound together through underground networks of fungi that share carbon, nutrients, and even resilience across species.
The forest, in other words, is a society. It thrives because the community adapts, shares, and endures together. Perhaps that realization may feel like a mirror for our own lives. “Ecosystems are similar to human societies — they’re built on relationships,” she wri…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection did more than explain evolution, it revealed how complexity can emerge without a designer. Nobel laureate Paul Nurse unpacks Darwin’s insights, from the logic of tiny differences to the profound impacts these variations have on our understanding of life.
Nurse explores the deep genetic connections linking all organisms, from humans to gorillas to yeast. This shared ancestry, he argues, reframes how we think about responsibility: If all life is related, what do we owe to the living world?

If you listen to any one of a number of disillusioned high-energy physicists (or wannabe physicists), you might conclude that it is.

We figured out what the fundamental forces and interactions governing physics were, what the fundamental constituents of matter were, how they assembled to form the world we observe and inhabit, and how to predict what the results of any experiment performed with those quanta would be.
Combined, the Standard Model of elementary particles and the standard model of cosmology represent the culmination of 20th century physics. Wh…]]></summary>

Psychiatrist Robert Waldinger, MD, psychologist Tal Ben-Shahar, PhD, and author-entrepreneur Peter Baumann share what 85 years of research and lived experience reveal about happiness. They explain why chasing it directly often backfires—and how strong relationships, mindfulness, and embracing every emotion can build a baseline of positivity that actually lasts.

Back in 2015, humanity didn’t know whether a core prediction of Einstein’s general relativity — the existence of energy-carrying gravitational waves — was true or not. We had theoretical predictions that these waves should be generated whenever a massive object moved and accelerated through a changing gravitational field, and we had observed orbital decay of binary systems (like binary pulsars) that were consistent with those predictions, but the ripples in spacetime themselves, or gravitational waves, had never been directly detected. For 100 years, this great prediction of physics remained unconfirmed.
