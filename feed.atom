It took him a while to find such a spot, but shortly thereafter, he set the place up with cameras and printers, and posters started going out. They read "Hey, Cultists! Want to prove your god is as good as you say? Then FIGHT ME. If your god's will can't take out one of my bodies, then is he even a god?! Come to [insert address here], and take me on! I'm not in short supply of these bodies!", and have a picture of the building and of Ace. From there, he waits for a challenger.
 /uw/ Pic unrelated. This post is mostly meant for anyone playing Dominox or his cultists, but I'd welcome a duel with any other cultists or cult leaders.

 A few hours ago, I was called to a side wing of the National Archives to inspect a "strange red crystal". Arriving there, I could confirm that it was, in fact, strange, red and a crystal. (Picture attached.)
 Subject: Strange Red Crystal
 We closed the Archives for a while and inspected the thing. It's roughly 30cm in length and has no immediately noticeable dangerous properties. Regardless, we had it carefully packed up and moved to the Geology Section.
 Any attempts to split off a part of the crystal for material testing were unsuccessful, like it's indestructible by our regular tools. We didn't want to damage it too badly either. At some point, I accidentally held it in my bare hands which l…]]></summary>

 Null walks through one of the normal portals, entering the hallway containing the special one. He sees it, and phases through the chains.
 on the other side, he sees an enormous cave, and it’s all covered in the same black glass-like material, slowly creeping through. He spies a red suit of armor standing impassively nearby.
 *The First Curse’s voice booms from every direction of the cave.
 “I trust it’s with you?”
 “Correct, curse.”
