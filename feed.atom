The second is the Opera Cake (Gâteau Opéra), a stacked and striped dessert with thin almond cake layers soaked in espresso syrup, chocolate ganache, and a rich espresso buttercream. The difference between the first cake and the second is that the second recipe was never going to happen.

In the nearly two decades of Smitten Kitchen’s existence, I’ve again and again begun researching what a homemade opera cake would entail and every time, slammed the proverbial book shut because it was just too much. A joconde! French buttercream! Soaking syrup! Chocolate layer! Many separated eggs! And what about all of that espresso? There are children present! And elderly people (me) who probably shouldn’t drink coffee after 4pm! If I could barely talk myself into it, how would I convince you? Maybe some things are best left to the professionals, I concluded.

That’s the basic yet seismic question on a lot of people’s minds. But here’s the thing: It’s oversimplified, attempting to color an unprecedentedly gray moment either black or white. And what does the query even mean? If you’re asking about whether or not the valuations of certain AI startups and the companies that supply them are overvalued relative to their current financials, there’s a strong case for answering in the affirmative. If you’re asking whether the hype over AI has raced ahead of the technological landscape in regards to it attaining artificial general intelligence or rapidly destroying the labor market — the answer might be “probably.” 
But if you’re asking whether AI will ultimately fizzle out and go down in history as the fever dream of a science-fiction…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To sell or not to sell — that’s the question many entrepreneurs ask themselves when their startups manage to beat the imposing odds and achieve financial success. Sell too soon, and you may lose out on growth that’s yet to come. Wait too long, and you risk cashing out after your business has already peaked.
At one point, Andrew Gazdecki belonged to the second of these two cohorts. “I held on because I was attached,” he says of his first company, Bizness Apps, which he sold in 2017. The company, a publishing platform that helps businesses develop mobile apps, began life in 2010, riding the smartphone revolution kickstarted by Apple. When, years later, Bizness Apps began losing customers, and continued losing customers, part of Gazdecki knew it was time to sell. And yet he waited.

The stars, shining brightly throughout the sky, will all someday burn out; the galaxies will someday turn dark. Even if the timescales for some of these phenomena are barely fathomable to the human mind, the fact remains that everything within the Universe, and even the Universe itself, will someday cease to exist as we know it.

The atmosphere of a Gothic novel creeps over you; encroaching mist along the outcroppings. Nowhere felt as immersive to me as the coast I’ve described in southern Maine. Into that atmosphere, a ghost ship was born after it never came home.
Along Casco Bay and around the Harpswell-Freeport region, repeated, spectral sightings of a schooner named the Dash have been seen along the irregular, rocky coastlines for over two centuries.
The Dash, at any moment, may try in vain to dock again to change her fate. She might be an omen of inclement weat…]]></summary>

Case in point: a few weeks ago, Dr. Susan Schneider — the philosopher, author, and cognitive scientist — emailed me in response to a recent newsletter I had written. Her message turned into a phone call, which then developed into a deep and unexpected exchange about the real risks of AI.
Susan and I ended up shaping that conversation into a recent Long Game column for Big Think, where Susan introduced me to some of her latest work, focusing on the “megasystem problem”: networks of AI systems colluding in ways we can’t anticipate. Her perspective is fascinating, and it’s exactly the kind of conversation I hope this newsletter continues to spark.

The speed of light, even though it’s the fastest speed that any signal can travel throughout the Universe, is still finite. No matter how close or distant an object is, you’re only seeing it as it was a particular amount of time ago: at the moment the now-arriving light was emitted from the object you’re observing. The fact that light has to travel through space, from the emitted object to the observer that sees it, explains why there’s a gap that we have to fill in through inference alone.
Every observer in the Universe, so long as they haven’t spent a large amount of time traveling close to the speed of light (or in an extraordinarily large gravitation…]]></summary>

I’m calling this activity “replanting” — because it feels like moving a neglected plant, perhaps crowded by weeds and eaten by bugs, into a new garden, where it will be cared for and nurtured again.
Of course, I’m borrowing from the digital garden approach to personal publishing advocated by Maggie Appleton and others.  Maggie even uses the term “plant” to mean posting an item (and “tend” to edit). That’s probably where the similarities end, because Maggie defines a digital garden as a collection of notes — “evolving ideas that aren’t st…]]></summary>

Sometimes, you can be talking to someone for hours, and it feels like only a few minutes. You natter and natter without ever having to think of what to say or cringe through any awkward silence. There’s a gentle sway to things — you listen, they speak, they listen, you speak. The chat dances to the easy and comfortable rhythm of the conversational tide.
At other times, a conversation can feel like medieval torture. One-word answers litter the path toward your desperate, fumbling attempt to get away. You’ve already used the toilet excuse, you’ve got a full drink, so you’re stuck in your chatless hell with Captain Boring.
“So, how often do you feed your dog?” you ask.
“It depends.”

According to Patrick McNamara PhD, Shelby Harris PsyD, DBSM, and Dave Asprey, sleep is imperative to restoring cells, regulating metabolism, consolidating memory, and synchronizing the body’s internal clocks. REM in particular aided human cultural evolution, allowing our ancestors to make creative leaps by connecting disparate ideas. With this powerful ability, humanity was able to advance past lives of pure survival and into ones filled with art, science, and culture.
We created this video for Brain Briefs, a Big Think interview series created in partnership with Unlikely Collaborators. As a creative non-profit organization, they’re on a mission to help people challenge their perceptions and expand their thinking. Often, that growth can start with just a single unlikely question that makes you rethink your convictions and adjust your vantage point. Visit Perception Box to see more in this series.

This is surprising, given philosophy’s very nature. It thrives on debate, supplying endless reasons to question one’s stance. Philosopher Will Buckingham once remarked that, if reasoned dialogue worked as we might expect, philosophers would be shifting their views “with a quicksilver frequency that would put the rest of us to shame.” After all, in a world teeming with critical colleagues and formidable counterarguments, one might imagine minds constantly turning over. The ideal philosopher, we assume, would be supple, guided by evidence, and willing to follow arguments wh…]]></summary>

We should not expect employees to be asked to endorse management’s idea that we need to come back to the office, but helping to lay out the case as to how it is done, whether and how exceptions should be made, and crucially, what did we learn from remote work that we can carry over requires employee involvement. Even something as simple as adding evidence from employee poll results to support some aspect of the change would help. Only 24% of employers surveyed their employees about their return to office plans in 2022. Whether that figure has increased is not clear.

The most likely cause of an increase in childhood deaths is malaria, which kills more than 400,000 children a year and can cause seizures. But there was no report of the spiking fevers that characterize malaria. Lack of fever also made pneumonia, the most common cause of childhood death, less likely. The absence of diarrhea and dehydration ruled out cholera and other intestinal infections, the third most common cause of death. Seizures can be a symptom of meningitis, which a…]]></summary>

There are approximately 90 naturally occurring species of atom that we can find on Earth, and approximately 30 more that we can synthesize under laboratory conditions. We’ve learned, thanks to the power of modern science, that atoms themselves are not fundamental, but rather can be divided into smaller chunks: electrons and an atomic nucleus, where the nucleus in turn can be further decomposed into protons and neutrons, which themselves are each made up of quarks and gluons. Only when we reach that deep of a level — the level of electrons, quarks, and gluons — do we encounter particles that are truly fundamental.

A period of cosmic inflation stretched space flat, seeding the Universe with quantum fluctuations.

From a region of space as small as can be imagined (all the way down to the Planck scale), cosmological inflation causes space to expand exponentially: relentlessly doubling and doubling again with each tiny fraction-of-a-second that elapses. Although this empties the Universe and stretches it flat, it also contains quantum fluctuations superimposed atop it: fluctuations that will later provide the seeds for cosmic structure within our own Universe. What happened before the final ~10^-32 seconds of inflation, including the question of whether inflation arose from a singular state before it, not only isn’t known, but may…]]></summary>

Off in the far-flung distance, at the limit of what even our most powerful telescopes can see, are galaxies speeding away from us so quickly that the light their stars emitted has been stretched to as much as twelve times their original wavelength. These stretched light waves are a consequence of the expanding Universe, and they are nearly, but not quite, identical for galaxies that we see in all directions in space.
Does that difference, and the fact that one direction has a slightly greater redshift for its objects than the opposite direction, tell us anything about where, all those billions of years ago, the Big Bang actu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My earliest lessons in observation came not from a laboratory but in the living room, with my father in his tuxedo and top hat. To everyone else, he was “Big Ed,” a larger-than-life physician who was a magician, an archer, a raconteur, and much else. By day, he mesmerized patients with his easy confidence; by night, he dazzled guests with sleight-of-hand, conjuring coins from behind ears or producing endless scarves from his sleeve. To me, he was both healer and illusionist, a scientist and showman.
When your father is a magician, what do you believe? As a child, the boundary between real and unreal was porous. I wanted to believe in the rabbit pulled from a hat, the floating light bulb, the miraculous escapes. But even as a boy, I began to notice the seams: the telltale flash of a hidden …]]></summary>

On his popular YouTube channel, Cool Worlds, Kipping takes viewers on in-depth explorations of subjects like planetary systems, interstellar travel, and the search for life beyond Earth.
I first met Kipping at the famous 2018 NASA technosignature meeting in Houston, where the space agency first indicated they would be open to funding work on intelligent life in the Universe. As we are both astrophysicists and science communicators, I wanted to discuss Kipping’s journey from a young stargazer to a Columbia professor, his work on life in the Universe, and the challenges of explaining science in the YouTube era.

It is a tale of two rulers and some hippos during one of the fragmented ‘Intermediate Periods’ (mid-second millennium BCE). One ruler was Apepi of the foreign Hyksos 15th Dynasty, at that time based in the delta city of Avaris. The other was Seqenenra Taa II, ruler of the simultaneous and rival 17th Dynasty, based down in Thebes. One day, Apepi sent a messenger south to Thebes to convey a complaint and an instruction to Seqenenra. 
Apepi claimed that he was being kept awake at night by ‘the hippopotami from the swamp … in the eastern waters of the city [of Thebes], because they do not allow that sleep come to me, day or night, because their noise is in his ear!’ Seqenenra…]]></summary>

Existentialism is often represented by Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, while absurdism is often represented by Albert Camus. All were French intellectuals active in the decades following World War II, and they knew one another. They drank, they danced, and they laughed together. But absurdism and existentialism are not the same.
In this week’s Mini Philosophy interview, I spoke with the philosopher and writer Laura Kennedy about Camus. Camus is often misidentified as an existentialist, and he is even on record as saying he was not one. In fact, as the years went on, the relationship between Sartre and Camus got frostier and frostier. So, behind the bitter op-eds and vi…]]></summary>

After Williams, Jeff went on to Oxford, Cambridge, and then earned his PhD in philosophy at Berkeley, so it’s no surprise he now makes his living persuading people with reasoning. (I just wish he’d go easier on me at dinner parties.)
His speech, which I encourage you to watch, was classic Jeff: gripping, funny, and deeply thoughtful.

As we see the Universe today, it appears full of stuff: matter, radiation, antimatter, neutrinos, and even dark matter and dark energy, despite the fact that we don’t truly know the ultimate, fundamental nature of the latter two. Yet even if you took away every single quantum of energy, somehow removing it from the Universe entirely, you wouldn’t be left with an empty Universe. No matter how much you take out of it, the Universe will always generate new forms of energy.
How is this possible? It’s like the Universe itself doesn’t understand our idea of “nothing” at all; if we were to remove all the quanta of energy from our Universe, leaving behind only empty space, we woul…]]></summary>

Imagine waking up to a persistent signal. Your intuition acknowledges your many achievements but senses the potential for different experiences. 
Perhaps while working your current job or engaged in daily activities, you find yourself frequently lost in thoughts of a life more in tune with your deepest passions. When the endeavors that once sparked joy and excitement in you no longer fuel the fire inside but deplete it, it’s a clear sign that a new path awaits.

If the Universe is expanding and cooling today, that implies a past that was smaller, denser, and hotter. In our imaginations, we can extrapolate back to arbitrarily small sizes, high densities, and hot temperatures: all the way to a singularity, where all of the Universe’s matter and energy was condensed in a single point. For many decades, these two notions of the Big Bang — of the hot dense state that describes the early Universe and the initial singularity — were inseparable.
But beginning in the 1970s, scientists started identifying some puzzles surrounding the Big Bang, noting several properties of the Universe that weren’t explainable within the context of these two no…]]></summary>

But like many other software projects before and since, it got delayed. Finally, in May, the new version of BowieNet was launched.

Dr. Susan Schneider calls this the “megasystem problem”: networks of AI models colluding in ways we can’t predict, producing emergent structures beyond human control. It’s also something she believes is one of the most urgent — and overlooked — risks we face today with AI today.
Schneider has been thinking about these questions long before ChatGPT or Claude became household names.

In word associations, the two words usually belong to the same semantic category but are set off by a salient contrast (night–day, girl–boy, dog–cat). Like laughter, tears express an emotional state by means other than the muscles of the face. They are involuntary, conspicuous to a perceiver, and unique to Homo sapiens (a conclusion flaunted in the title of the most comprehensive book on the subject, the psychologist Ad Vingerhoets’s Why Only Humans Weep). And they seem engineered to generate common knowledge.

Many founders assume that hiring a public relations firm (or an on-staff PR lead) will quickly get them regular, glowing write-ups in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, which they can then share with their target audiences on Facebook or LinkedIn to drive demand and generate leads. Or better yet, they might get physical press clippings, which are a nice ego boost, even though fewer and fewer people read printed newspapers and magazines. These clips can be framed to adorn office hallways or sent to family members to stick on the fridge.

Whenever our prevailing picture of reality — including the rules it plays by, the physical contents of a system, and how it evolved from its initial conditions to the present time — gets challenged by new experimental or observational data, we must open our minds to changing our conceptual picture of the cosmos. This has happened many times since the dawn of the 20th century, and the words we use to describe our Universe have shifted in meaning as our understanding has evolved.

By the time you ask this question, it’s already too late. Exit interviews might surface useful insights, but they can’t undo the fact that employees are already walking out the door. Even stay interviews—meant to get ahead of problems—become a box-checking exercise, more about HR optics than improving the workplace.
In tough economic times, employee experience tends to take a backseat to productivity. Companies slip into old habits, reducing workforce investments and pushing people to “do more with less.” After all, employees should just be grateful to have jobs, right? People end up tolerating less-than-great environments to keep their paychecks. It’s an unfortunate cycle that keeps repeating.

On top of that, the company’s AI systems, built on proprietary LLMs, analyze real-time events at such unprecedented speed that whole new strata of planning and strategy become possible.

Founder of The Future of Free Speech Jacob Mchangama argues that free speech is not a threat but society’s strongest safeguard against violence. Suppressing expression creates a pressure cooker that can push people toward violent action when peaceful dissent is denied. While acknowledging its harms — especially in the digital age — Mchangama warns that censorship is far worse.

The Great Observatories Origins Deep Studies North field (GOODS-N), cropped to show the Universe’s most distant galaxy, in red.

Even as a child, Gall was fascinated by the brain and its connection with people’s personalities, and so throughout his career, he intensely studied its anatomy while also gathering data on people’s skull sizes and facial features.
He came to believe that people’s mental faculties were localized within specific brain regions. And because these regions molded the shape of people’s skulls, a trained eye could divinate a person’s capabilities for love, violence, greed, intelligence, and other traits simply by examining their cranial bumps and recessions.

But if it has passed peer review, people often assume that means everything that’s written in the paper — the methods of the study, the analysis performed, the results obtained, the conclusions drawn, and other assertions that the authors might make — must be correct.

Some teachers did so with the grudging monotone of the forced and underpaid employee. Some did it with the exhausting energy of a fanatic. Ms. Vasey, the physics teacher, even dressed up as the solar system. But Mr. Smith decided to win us over with the cold, lofty logic of an Oxford graduate.
“History is like a guidebook for how to live,” he began. “We can learn from people’s mistakes and can unpack where things went wrong. Almost all the greatest leaders in the world knew their history, and almost all of the biggest mistakes were …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was younger, my mental image of an “investor” was someone who sat in an office, cranked out spreadsheets, wore a suit, listened to earnings calls, and traded stocks. In reality, investing — at least how we like to do it — is the opposite. Your job is to go out of the office, talk to people, travel the world, and try to understand where the future might be headed — so you can place your bets accordingly.
In that spirit, my colleague Daniel Crowley, CFA, wrote about the two weeks he spent in China this summer. Dan visited electric car companies, cruised through Macau, immersed himself in a humanoid robotics conference (where he saw an android dog with a fake machine gun strapped to its back!) and much more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the first theorems anyone learns in mathematics is the Pythagorean Theorem: if you have a right triangle, then the square of the longest side (the hypotenuse) will always equal the sums of the squares of the other two sides. The first integer combination that this works for is a triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5: 3² + 4² = 5². There are other combinations of numbers that this works for, too, including:
5, 12, and 13,
6, 8, and 10,
7, 24 and 25,
and infinitely more. But 3, 4, and 5 are special: they’re the only consecutive whole numbers that obey the Pythagorean Theorem. In fact, the numbers 3, 4, and 5 are the only consecutive whole numbers that allow you to solve the equation a² + b² = c² at all!
However, if you allowed yourself the freedom to include more numbers, you could imagine …]]></summary>

Some findings are, of course, more significant than others, and in fact do get us closer to that long-hoped-for announcement. First, though, we have to understand all the ways that nature — especially Martian nature — might deceive us.

Three experts, Aditi Nerurkar, MD, MPH, Kelly McGonigal, PhD, and Jon Kabat-Zinn, PhD combine their insights on physiology, psychology, and mindfulness to show how stress management can become a superpower. They explain how stress can help you grow, how the body’s “challenge response” fuels focus and energy, and how mindfulness can help you see beyond your thoughts.
We created this video for Brain Briefs, a Big Think interview series created in partnership with Unlikely Collaborators.

From across the Universe, a black hole of 36 times the mass of the Sun merged with another of 29 times the Sun’s mass, producing a remnant black hole of just 62 solar masses, with the other 3 solar masses getting converted into gravitational radiation via Einstein’s E = mc².
When those emitted waves arrived in each of the twin LIGO detectors, they changed the length of LIGO’s incredibly long, precise laser arms by less than the width of a single proton. Yet …]]></summary>

By the start of 2000, blogging was becoming a communal activity. One of its pioneers, Cameron Barrett, had a “Sites I Visit Often” list in his sidebar that had gotten longer over the past year and now included many weblogs. Although there wasn’t a word for this kind of list at the time, it would eventually become known as a “blogroll” (the earliest reference to this term I could find was Doc Searls in December 2000, who used the word “blogrolling” as a subheader).

CamWorld's impressive "blogroll" in March 2000, even though the term hadn't yet been coined.
Some webloggers were even meeting in person. On 20 February, Jessamyn West wrote in her online journal: “I had a nice day. Mucked about in the morning, headed to …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In all the world, and perhaps in all the Universe, there’s no greater question one can ask than the question of one’s own origins. For us, as human beings, this comes up often in our early childhood: we see, touch, and experience the world around us, and wonder where it all comes from. We look at ourselves and those around us, and wonder about our own origins. Even when we look to the heavens, and take in the spectacular sights of the night sky — the Moon, the planets, the stars, the glorious plane of the Milky Way, plus deep-sky objects — we’re filled with a sense of awe, wondering where the lights, and perhaps even the vast, empty darkness that separates them, all came from.

But it had downsides as well. It also accelerated the spread of what you could reasonably politely call propaganda and what you could less politely call manipulative, destructive lies. Also, the spread of knowledge had unanticipated knock-on effects.
The Catholic Church was thrilled with the power of the press when the innovation helped raise cash for the Church’s crusades and get more Bibles into the hands of more people. Perhaps it was less thrilled when the press provided propaganda for both sides in Mainz’s 1462 civil war. And, of course, many Church leaders likely cursed the technology the Church had helped create when rapid printing hastened Martin Luth…]]></summary>

Two of their pupils had achieved a reading rate in excess of 100,000 words per minute, more than ten times the speed of the Academy’s average student and more than 300 times what a college-educated adult can muster (between 200 and 400 words per minute). Would he be willing to assess their prodigious skills in a laboratory setting?

Self-understanding is the foundation of effective leadership. However, society doesn’t emphasize self-understanding.

This was caused by the NASA spacecraft Osiris-Rex, which collected the resulting dust and returned those samples to Earth, marking the first time a U.S. mission had retrieved material from an asteroid. 
Earlier this year, researchers found those samples contained the building blocks for life, including amino acids and nucleobases (which form DNA, among other molecules). That’s not unusual for an asteroid, but what was unexpected was the form those molecules took: roughly half of them being a perfect inverse — a mirror image — of the way those building blocks appear on Earth.
This was interesting timing. Only a few months prior, toward the end of 2024, a te…]]></summary>

The spinach and feta pie, AKA spanakopita, on which this recipe is based is deeply rooted in Greek culinary history. So I probably shouldn’t have messed with it, but I did, because I’m a tinkerer. I wanted a lot of spring onions, you see, because, together, cooked green onions and spinach are a bittersweet fantastic dream, especially when they’re tempered with some creamy ricotta. But then, to stop it from getting too sleepy, I escalated the fresh herbs, kept the sharp feta (I’m not a monster) and finished it with a fresh lemon and pine nut salsa. Same same, but actually quite a bit different.

Even with the advantage of large, powerful telescopes, even from far above the limitations of Earth’s atmosphere in space, there are still enormous portions of the Universe that are virtually invisible to our optical telescopes. The reason why? Because enormous portions of the Universe are blocked by cosmic dust: small, cold grains of atom-based matter that absorb and block the visible wavelengths of light that human eyes have adapted to see. They obscure enormous regions of the galactic plane, and hinder our ability to observe star-forming regions, planet-forming disks, and objects that lie behind and beyond the plane of the Milky Way.

Although many philosophers and theologians accept mortality as an inevitable and indeed defining feature of human existence, Kurzweil refuses to accept this line of thinking. “Death is a great tragedy, a profound loss,” he declares in the film, haunted by the memory of losing his father at age 22. “I don’t accept it.”
Kurzweil would have found an ally in the little-known 19th-century Russian philosopher Nikolai Fedorov, whose posthumously published text Philosophy of the Common Task made the at-the-time daring argument that death was little more than a design flaw — one which advancements in science and technology could help to rectify. Fedorov also believed that this goa…]]></summary>

I’ve been revisiting this quote lately because, in many ways, I feel Western democracies have gone fully through the looking glass when it comes to how we discuss politics.
The words we use to describe our positions and those of others often sit on shaky perches. They shift — not just in implication but sometimes even definitionally — based on the context, speaker, and audience, leaving us without a clear sense of what people mean. And perhaps no other word in politics today sits on a shakier perch than liberalism.
Consider that in the United States, a liberal is someone who stands on the political left, probably voted for Joe Biden, a…]]></summary>

My attention ping-ponged. The article deadline that felt manageable yesterday now loomed. The client presentation that should take an hour felt like it would consume my entire weekend. Even checking email felt like wading into a swamp.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The benefits of AI are immense. Unparalleled efficiency. Speed. Convenience. But every advantage carries a price tag. And I believe AI is a perfect example.
AI can radically simplify our lives (and I use it often), yet at the same time, it threatens to erode the very foundation of trust — trust in information, trust in institutions, and even trust in one another.
In the knowledge work age, your value was often measured by your IQ. But as Kevin Kelly argues, in the age of AI, the more critical metric is shifting. What matters most is no longer just intelligence, but what he calls the Trust Quotient — the ability to be authentic and develop trust in a world where machines can imitate almost everything else.
“Trust is a broad word that will be unbundled as it seeps into the AI ecosystem,” Kel…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you ask a scientist where the Universe got its start, “the Big Bang” is the answer you’re most likely to get, as for over 60 years now, the scientific evidence that’s come in favoring that theory has overwhelmed all alternatives. Our Universe may be full of stars, galaxies, and a cosmic web of large-scale structure, all separated by the vastness of empty space between them, but it wasn’t born that way. It’s a profound realization that our cosmos hasn’t existed in its current form forever. Instead, the Universe came to be this way because it expanded and cooled from a hot, dense, uniform, matter-and-radiation-filled state with no galaxies, stars, or even simple atoms present at the outset.
Everything, as it exists in its current form, wasn’t the way it is today back some 13.8 billion yea…]]></summary>

“How about the south of France?” Judy says.

Back and forth it goes until they settle on a nice compromise along the Tuscan coast. Liam can ride his bike, Judy can swim in the sea, and the kids can go to the amusement park 30 minutes away. With one click of “Confirm,” a year’s savings evaporate.
The airport is a bustling, heaving business, and the kids fight over the window seat. And it’s downhill from there. The beaches are so busy that they cannot find a spot big enough for them all. The mountain bike trails are a muddy churn with hour-long queues at the top. The amusement park is more expensive than the flights. And, to top it all off, it’s col…]]></summary>

It offered us Google, and then Wikipedia, and with them a curious kind of magic: everything we ever wanted to know, right there, blinking in front of us. It was harmless enough, even liberating. We no longer had to argue about who directed Casablanca or the difference between a quark and a lepton. Answers flowed like tap water.
But something happened in that flood. We began mistaking the map for the terrain.
Not long after came the shortcuts — CliffsNotes for Shakespeare, then for Kant, then for life itself. Everything abstract or difficult was carved into quick summaries, punchy headlines, 30-second reels.

Tyler Volk, PhD, Bruce Greyson, MD, and BJ Miller, MD, have studied death from the perspective of biology, psychiatry, and palliative care, and together they reveal that it’s far more than a clinical endpoint. According to them, it’s time to change how we understand mortality, seeing it as both central to evolution and something to be reclaimed from medicine’s grip.

When we thought about finding an inhabited world out there in the Milky Way, we had only the worlds of our Solar System — Earth, Venus, Mars, Neptune, Titan, Pluto, Enceladus, Triton, and Jupiter’s moons — to consider as potential analogues. Now in 2025, however, we’re closing in on an incredible 6000 confirmed exoplanets, and we’ve learned that the most common type of world that we know of isn’t represented at all in our Solar System: a class of worlds known as super-Earths and mini-Neptunes.

In the 18th century, astronomers realized that this too was wrong. The Sun was but one star among many moving through that great assembly of stars we call the Milky Way. 
What’s more, many Enlightenment thinkers also suspected that the center of the cosmos was not even the Milky Way — they thought there were other galaxies in the depths of space. In the late-17th century, the French physicist and mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace summarized this new cosmic understanding when he wrote, “[M]an now appear…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every once in a while, a book arrives in my inbox that forces me to rethink what I thought I knew about the human mind. Angus Fletcher’s Primal Intelligence is one of those books. Released in August, it has already become a national bestseller — and for good reason.
Fletcher is a rare hybrid: trained as both a neuroscientist and a professor of literature, he teaches at Ohio State’s Project Narrative, the world’s leading academic center for the study of story. His previous titles — Wonderworks and Storythinking — earned him a reputation as a boundary-breaking thinker who blends science, history, and art to explain why stories matter and how they shape human creativity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When most of us think about science, we don’t often think about something very fundamental to the enterprise: what the goal of it all actually is. Reality is a complicated place, and the only tools we have to guide us in understanding what it is and how it works is the combination of what we can observe, measure, and experiment on. When we add up the full suite of that body of observational and experimental knowledge, we have a record of all the phenomena that we know exists. The enterprise of science, then, seeks to make sense of all of it, and to explain it as simply and powerfully as possible: to maximize our predictive power of nature’s phenomena with as few assumptions, parameters, and variables as are absolutely necessary.

On Tuesday, 11 January, 2000, the front page of The New York Times announced a corporate merger that seemed to confirm the internet’s cultural ascendency. “America Online Agrees to Buy Time Warner for $165 Billion,” the headline blared. Under the subhead “Internet Triumph,” the NYT noted that it “would be the biggest merger in history and the best evidence yet that old and new media are converging.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s hard to believe, but it was only back in the early 1990s that we discovered the very first planet orbiting a star other than our own Sun. Fast forward to the present day, here in 2025, and we’re closing in on 6000 confirmed exoplanets, found and measured through multiple techinques: the transit method, the stellar wobble method, and even direct imaging. That last one is so profoundly exciting because it gives us hope that, someday soon, we might be able to take direct images of Earth-like worlds, some of which may even be inhabited.



Although it may be a long time before we can get an exoplanet image as high-resolution as even the ultra-distant “pale blue dot” photo that Voyager took of Earth so many decades ago, the fact remains that science is advancing rapidly, and things that seemed impossible mere decades ago now reflect today’s reality. And the people driving this fascinating field forward the most are the mostly unheralded workhorses of the fields of physics and astronomy: the early-career researchers, like grad students and postdocs, who are just beginning to establish themselves as scientists.



In this fascinating conversation with Dr. Kielan Hoch of Space Telescope Science Institute, we take a long walk at the current frontiers of science and peek over the horizon: looking at the good, the bad, and the ugly of what we’re facing here in 2025. It’s a conversation that might make you hopeful, angry, and optimistic all at the same time. After all, it’s your Universe too; don’t you want to know what comes next?

My grandmother, Narmada Lakhani, passed away earlier this year aged 92. Well, we think she was 92, but no one recorded her birth date, so we can only estimate. What we do know about her, though, is that she had a very cheeky laugh, and that she loved lager tops, penny slot machines and tucking £10 notes down her bra, ready to hand out to an unsuspecting grandchild as a gift. She never asked if I was happy, only if I’d eaten well, which I assume to her were the same thing. At this time of year, eating well for her meant tucking into sweetcorn, so, in her memory, I’m going to do the same.

But when we think about the biggest advances in scientific history, they often occur in revolutionary leaps, completely overthrowing our previously held views of how the Universe works. In particular, revolutions like Special Relativity and General Relativity, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, and the Big Bang and cosmic inflation completely overthrew our prior picture of how things actually behave. As the “holy grail” of physics, many have long sought a Theory of Everything, seeking to explain every particle, phenomenon, and interaction in all the Universe within a single framework, and possibly even wi…]]></summary>

People have swum across the Strait, and it is easy to see from Spain to Morocco on a normal, clear day. It seems like it would not take much for nature to simply close that connection between Europe and Africa, and in so doing isolate the Mediterranean Sea. Indeed, this has happened before.
About six million years ago, something caused the Mediterranean to be cut off. Perhaps it was an ice age that decreased the sea level enough to leave a land bridge between Spain and Morocco. The Mediterranean’s isolation could also have been the outcome of tectonic processes.

At the heart of it is this: for me, studying the past provides a living playbook for how to build systems that can withstand shocks and endure for generations. And the high-level pattern emerging across my research is clear: longevity comes from honoring tradition while evolving slowly, and centering trust with employees and communities.

That core-generated energy helps keep the Sun from contracting under its own gravitation, but also propagates to the Sun’s edge, the photosphere, where the Sun emits radiation over a wide range of wavelengths that correspond to a temperature of around 6000 K. Although the Moon is the second-brightest object in most wavelengths of light, it only appears so bright because of its very close proximity to Earth.

the fact that it emits its own infrared radiation, making it the only planet to emit more light on its own than it reflects from the Sun,
the fact that it has the largest effect, of any planet, on the wobbling orbit of our parent star,
the fact that it’s well-separated from our parent star, making it an easier target for direct imaging than any of the rocky planets,
and the fact that, if viewed from afar at the right perspective, it would block more of the Sun’s light than any other planet during a transit event.
Earth may be of interest to us, since we live on it, but to an external observer, our Solar System…]]></summary>

When AOL completed its acquisition of Netscape in March 1999, a part of the old web died forever. By the end of the year (and the century), Netscape's share of the browser market had shrunk to about 20% and Microsoft's Internet Explorer had become dominant.
Meanwhile, the dot-com bubble continued to expand, with IPOs from Nvidia (now the world's most valuable company), Netscape co-founder Jim Clark's Healtheon, priceline.com, Ask Jeeves, Red Hat, TiVo, Akamai and others. Also, Google received its first VC funding round in June and declared its bold goal “to organize the world’s information, making it universally accessible and useful.”

The decision came after advance copies met an online backlash regarding a character readers argued was racist, MAGA-coded, and fangirled over Elon Musk (persona non grata of the progressive left for, well, obvious reasons).
In response, Lark posted a statement on Instagram. While the statement has since been removed, according to reporting at the time, Lark apologized and promised to revisit the book “to ensure that [her] work doesn’t contribute to harm” and listen “more closely to our sensitivity readers” in the future. Though she added, her character was intended to be “flawed.”

began with a period of cosmic inflation that preceded and set up the hot Big Bang,
then the hot Big Bang occurred, creating a dense, hot, mostly uniform Universe,
containing normal matter and radiation, but dominated by dark matter and dark energy,
which gravitated, expanded, and cooled,
forming the light elements, neutral atoms, stars, galaxies, and black holes,

It might seem strange, but I’d just read an excerpt in history class, and it had sounded like perfect reading for any young person looking to make their way in the world. There’s a lot of pragmatic wisdom in The Prince, all focused on achieving significant leadership goals. However, as the critics of its time so succinctly put it, one key message of the book is that, when it comes to leadership, “the ends justify the means.” Although it is now often regarded as an outdated manual for acquiring and maintaining power, some of the utilitarian conclusions that Machiavelli draws are very similar to how outcome-oriented leaders rationalize their achievements…]]></summary>

Psychologist Sarah Schnitker explains why virtue grows best when rooted in purpose beyond the self. Through studies of marathon runners fundraising for clean water, she shows how pro-social and spiritual motivations—not just personal fitness goals—led to deeper growth in generosity, patience, and self-control.
This research challenges the idea that self-improvement alone leads to virtue. When moral purpose and shared meaning enter the picture, transformation becomes more than personal: it becomes relational and lasting.

The extent of the visible Universe now goes on for 46.1 billion light-years: the distance that light emitted at the instant of the Big Bang would be located from us today, after a 13.8 billion year journey. As time marches on, light that’s even farther away, that is still on its way to us, will eventually arrive: from slightly greater distances and with slightly greater redshifts. We see into the past when we look out to great distances because the light emitted from distant objects must traverse those great intergalactic distances at a finite speed: the speed of light.

This recipe is too off-the-beaten-track from a traditional Hawaiian poké for me to call it such and live with myself, but it is loosely based around the idea of one. It starts with seasoned sushi rice (which I could eat just by itself) and is topped with a variety of fun things to munch on such as salt- and lime-seasoned cabbage, edamame beans and glazed pieces of barbecued tempeh, all bound together with a gentle but perky sriracha sauce. Like many of us today, it borrows ideas from all over the world and is, I think, all the more delicious for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Einstein’s theory of relativity is one of the most mind-bending theories ever devised. In it, moving clocks tick more slowly than stationary ones, and rulers shrink. Perhaps the most shocking consequence of all is that nothing can travel faster than light.
This last one is very disappointing to space enthusiasts, as it dooms their hopes of ever speedily exploring the cosmos. Space is vast, with the closest star located four light years away. Even a simple radio signal, which travels at the fastest speed possible, will take eight years to make a round trip.
The idea that there is a maximum speed is pretty counterintuitive; after all, in everyday experience, you can make a car go faster simply by stepping harder on the gas or upgrading to a sports car. In rocketry, you can just let the rocke…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why do many of us struggle with exercise when it’s essential for our well-being? Evolutionary biologist Daniel Lieberman says that it’s not laziness: it’s evolution. 
For most of human history, conserving energy was of utmost importance: The key to survival: motion without purpose would be a waste.
Lieberman explains why modern fitness feels unnatural, why guilt-driven workouts will always fail, and what hunter-gatherer lifestyles reveal about health today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The story of the expanding Universe has been a back-and-forth one over the past 110 years: ever since general relativity was first introduced. Initially, Einstein introduced the notion of a cosmological constant — a form of energy inherent to the fabric of space itself — to prevent a matter-filled Universe from collapsing. When we discovered that the Universe was expanding, the constant disappeared, eventually leading Einstein to declare it his biggest blunder. Then in the 1990s, a surprising collection of data indicated that the Universe’s expansion was accelerating, a discovery that revived the cosmological constant. The combination of supernova, cosmic microwave background, and large-scale structure data all appeared to demand it.

On January 26, 1999, Cameron Barrett — who ran a website called Camworld — pondered the meaning of a new term he’d recently discovered:
“A few months back, I heard the term weblog for the first time. I'm not sure who coined it or where it came from, so I can't properly credit it. Typically, a weblog is a small web site, usually maintained by one person that is updated on a regular basis and has a high concentration of repeat visitors. Weblogs often are highly focused around a singular subject, an underlying theme or unifying concept.”

Thus began a multi-year process of people trying to define what a weblog is. One of the better efforts was Rebecca Blood’s article, …]]></summary>

Gibson called an “ambient optic array” — the structured pattern of light reaching your eyes. Light reflects off surfaces, passes through the cornea and lens, and lands on the retina, where photons trigger the photoreceptors that kick off neural processing.
Of course, we do not see a world of individual photons. We see a world of meaningful things — things that we build with, cook with, play with, fight with, and use. Gibson argued that we see the world in terms of “affordances,” where we see objects as opportunities for action. We think, “What can I use this thing for?” and “What’s it good at?”

In a Noema essay, the forest ecologist and author Suzanne Simard explores how trees offer us a different kind of wisdom: they are part of a living intelligence, bound together through underground networks of fungi that share carbon, nutrients, and even resilience across species.
The forest, in other words, is a society. It thrives because the community adapts, shares, and endures together. Perhaps that realization may feel like a mirror for our own lives. “Ecosystems are similar to human societies — they’re built on relationships,” she wri…]]></summary>

Nurse explores the deep genetic connections linking all organisms, from humans to gorillas to yeast. This shared ancestry, he argues, reframes how we think about responsibility: If all life is related, what do we owe to the living world?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What if the secret to a happier life wasn’t constant joy, but something far more balanced?
Psychiatrist Robert Waldinger, MD, psychologist Tal Ben-Shahar, PhD, and author-entrepreneur Peter Baumann share what 85 years of research and lived experience reveal about happiness. They explain why chasing it directly often backfires—and how strong relationships, mindfulness, and embracing every emotion can build a baseline of positivity that actually lasts. 
We created this video for Brain Briefs, a Big Think interview series created in partnership with Unlikely Collaborators. As a creative non-profit organization, they’re on a mission to help people challenge their perceptions and expand their thinking. Often that growth can start with just a single unlikely question that makes you rethink your convictions and adjust your vantage point. Visit Perception Box to see more in this series.

Back in 2015, humanity didn’t know whether a core prediction of Einstein’s general relativity — the existence of energy-carrying gravitational waves — was true or not. We had theoretical predictions that these waves should be generated whenever a massive object moved and accelerated through a changing gravitational field, and we had observed orbital decay of binary systems (like binary pulsars) that were consistent with those predictions, but the ripples in spacetime themselves, or gravitational waves, had never been directly detected. For 100 years, this great prediction of physics remained unconfirmed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BowieWorld, via mutant ratz on YouTube.
In January 1999, BowieNet members were sent a CD that contained software for BowieWorld, a 3D chat environment built by a company called Worlds.com. It was a basic version of what Second Life would eventually launch in 2003 — a virtual world in which cartoonish three dimensional avatars roamed a blocky world and text-chatted with each other.
BowieWorld still exists today, albeit in a zombie state. In 2022, Worlds.com attempted to kick-start it again with an NFT promotion, launched at the 2022 David Bowie World Fan Convention. However, there have been no further updates since then. A Reddit community for Worlds.com shows it still has fans, but recent entries complain of server issues and “total radio silence” from the company.

One of my daily pleasures is to take some eggs and transform them into dinner. My knee-jerk reaction is an omelette, egg fried rice, the occasional okonomiyaki but not usually fried eggs, which are still working on their acceptance into my dinner canon. Recently, they made a bid for my affection via these Malaysian eggs, or telur masak kicap, in which they are doused in an onion, sweet soy, garlic and chilli sauce that works splendidly over rice. Welcome to the party, fried eggs.

For web users, 1998 was all about which portal you frequented. Was it Yahoo! with its massive directory of links (and partnership with the search engine AltaVista)? Was it the browser company portals, MSN or Netcenter? Was it the VC-funded Excite or Lycos? All of them wanted your eyeballs and ran terrible adverts on tv to get them.
Web business was booming, but it was also becoming obvious which companies were winning and which were losing.
