 No one was certain what happened to the Bloody Butcher to make him the way he was, very few wanted to know. The first time anyone heard of him was thirty years before the Conqueror arrived, a son flew home from school one day to find both parents in peices hanging from the roof and decorating the walls. Then the son heard a noise from the kitchen, a noise like someone eating cheese like their life depended on it. When someone came to investigate, they only found a pile of miscellaneous body parts at the centre of a pool of bodily fluids, all three missing their spin…]]></summary>

 Going inside she casts detect magic detecting something in the middle of the temple. She starts walking towards it activating a series of traps on the way there.
 She reaches the middle of the temple with burned robes and an arrow through her hat. In the middle there's a pedestal with a potion on it, apon further inspection the potion has a label "age giving potion" 
 Oriana: sweet!
 She takes the potion and the pedestal goes down. After it goes fully down a curse comes out in a form of mist, completely surrounding her. After a bit the mist disappears and Orioana isn't quite there anymore.
 Orion: I'm back! Let's go!
 Noiro in Orion's brain: that's nice, wait...
 Oriana in Orion's brain: what is this place? Why is it full of catgirls?
 Noiro: oh no she's here...
 Oriana: who are you? You look like me, but you're a guy
 Noiro: I'm Orion's "evil" version, it seems you're now stuck with me in his brain 
 Oriana: I'm fine with that sweetheart~
 Noiro: noooooooooo

 I have crossed that line long ago where mana intake is far more than my output could be if I was casting 24/7 so I want a fresh take from wizards that are still working out an answer. I find how each school of magic tends to answer this with a new perspective each generation of wizards that are born to take on the line of teaching.
