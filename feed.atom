        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lately I've been unable to sleep well.
 I keep having this weird dream.
 I'm in the beach with my friends.
 We play and laugh together.
 Then a great wave forms on the horizon.
 I try to run, but my legs refuse to obey.
 The wave keeps getting bigger, covering the sun.
 And then I wake up.
 "Bro is gonna make it!"
 The youths cheered and laughed as Caspian kept climbing the palm tree, he tried to hide his own fear with bravado, but the truth was, he had never been a fan of heights.
 "You better prepare that gem Dylan! I'm almost at the top!"
 That was the reason why he was doing this, Dylan had an impressive collection of rocks and other baubles he had collected from all across their island, including a particularly nice gem, nice enough to be the perfect present for a certain person.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This reality is home to countless worlds and realms. Some need special entrances, some need special portals, some can be stumbled into by any unlucky explorer.
 One day a group of cavers were gearing up for a spelunking session. They'd recently found a wonderful cave called the crevice of darkness and despair. A perfect place to go down. One by one they squeezed through the crack in the rock. Instantly they were surrounded in darkness. Not an issue in the slightest, all of them knew basic light spells. They lit up some of spells and looked around.
 Nothing remarkable, big crack on one side of the chamber, a passage further down on the other. They'd gone in, now they went further. Down the passage they found a sudden drop off into a river. Very strong current. They needed to be careful. Slo…]]></summary>

His face is scarred and hardened, obsidian-like cracks formed across his grey complexion. Flickers of recognition course behind his ghostly silver eyes. Memories of an age long ago, of a life long since dead. Yet, the flames of resentment burn as bright as ever.
 His reminiscing is broken on arrival. A massive, black temple bleeds into reality, floating on this sea of nothing like a slumbering giant. Another figure, clad in similar robes and a mechanical mask, waits on a precipice overlooking the void. The grey man touches down on the obsidian slab, floating with an ethereal grace despite his wracked appearance. Still, his visage remains dark and …]]></summary>

 All across the Nine Hells, from the gleaming resorts of the Fourth Circle to the eternal pub brawls of the Seventh, broadcast orbs and televisions flickered, switching to the emergency channel. Every diabolic resident turned their attention to the screen, greeted by the smirking visage of their leader—John E. Hellfire, microphone in hand, standing beside a large crimson curtain.
