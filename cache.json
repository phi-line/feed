          "description": "Physical description:\n Ranging anywhere between 430 and 510 meters long, the Star-Whale bares a striking resemblance to aquatic mammals from Earth, hence it's name. However the Star-Whale has much larger almost glowing ethereal-like fins averaging at half the length of the Star-Whale per flipper. It's tail follows a similar trend, being much larger and more ethereal than it's aquatic counterpart, the tail averages at a fifth the total length of the Whale but instances have been seen where specimens possess tails up to a third of the total length.\n The Star-Whale possesses a large array of both front and side facing eyes on its upper jaw capable of seeing anything within 180, degrees with incredible clarity. Near the center of the creatures head there are two long trailing appendages capabl…",

The ground trembles as small chunks of earth are scattered over a wide area, raining down for a few seconds.\n \"Wow!\" my Simulacrum exclaims, \"I only had to deflect a few pebbles, but the pressure wave almost knocked the wind out of me.\" It gestures toward the point of impact, \"Look, we've even got a crater this time.\"\n I look and see a modest crater, about a meter or two across, at the center of an area wiped clean of standing stalks. \"That's got to be a twenty meter blast diameter at least.\" I say, mostly to myself. \"We're getting somewhere, but it's too many layers. The grenade is too big.\"\n I sigh, just a bit worn from all the casting. \"Besides, the kill radius is still shorter than throwing distance. Multiplicative amplification isn't going to cut it.\"\n My Simulacrum chimes in saying \"Exponential boosting then? Time for the orange resonators?\"\n I think for a moment before replying \"I guess so, but I'll start with a smaller baseline, so things don't get out of hand too quickly.

At the sixth layer, my Simulacrum starts to get a bit uneasy.\n \"Remind me again why I'm standing out in the open, when you've got a perfectly good hidey-hole right there?\" it shouts to me.\n Without pausing the delicate process I shout back, \"I want visual observation of the tests, of course, and I can't be the one risking my neck. This one's real after all.\" After a momentary silence as I layer another abjuration my Simulacrum says \"I suppose that's true...\"\n I carry on to the tenth layer, then decide I'm satisfied. This time, it takes a few minutes of charging for the outer surface to get hot.\n It's almost unweildy in size, a bit more than a cubit across, but I gingerly get in position to launch it as far as I can then warn my Simulacrum. \"Get ready! Tenfold fireball in 3, 2, 1!\" The red orb goes flying and I duck down into the foxhole.\n I hear my Simulacrum bellowing quickened incantations I easily recognize as the payload arcs through the air, naturally casting my own spells.

Besides the rustling of trees, not a single noise broke the silence.\n There were many reports from the villages in the surrounding area. An adventurer, probably some kind of barbarian, wandering through, helping people. He was described as someone extremely tall, almost a giant. And despite his appearance, many said he was incredibly kind…\n The final clue was an R&A case, about a boy who killed his brother. Ulrick felt a bit uncomfortable reading that. Reminded him too much of his greatest mistake…\n But the report also held the final clue. Witnesses said the temperature of the room rose to an unnatural degree. This had to be it.\n Soon, the trees became more sparse as he walked on before he arrived in what appeared to be an abandoned town. Among the crumbling houses, Ulrick spotted a large silhouette…\n Hirk was there.\n Good thing he asked the Relief Force to make sure the area is clear of people. Time to correct the mistake of the elections. His own victory.\n From a mass of darkness, his Nightbite great axe manifested into his left hand, before he stepped out among the buildings to greet his friend.\n /uw time of Hirk vs Ulrick duel has arrived\n    submitted by    /u/UlrickTheHexblade  \n [link]   [comments]",
