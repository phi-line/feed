          "description": "Mary is led down one of the many paths of Lamentations in the empire. Her hands bond behind her and her feet chained in such a way that prevents her escape mainly by having those chains tied to the hand bindings of the person in front of her. The method of restraint is repeated over and over and over again in an endless tide of people being brought in \n “Yemhir, Taka Yemhir…Vascari…” voices in a language Mary did not understand. Some words could be heard. With others only the absence of language entered her ears\n The tide of people is supervised by the foot soldiers of the empire the Nehemjar. Her vision only allows her to see glimpses of them,the flash of a weapon, the crack of a thorn whip, the flash of a scorpion-esque stinger.

          "description": "Summoning spells sound self explanatory on their face. You summon something under your command. In reality summoning spells are a complex and varied field with spells often being personalized to the caster. In this spell book I'll cover a few of their forms. I will focus on general summoning for less sapient creatures as summoning intelligent beings is quite complex and often heavily specialized between summons. One thing almost every summoning spell has in common in that they form a one way rift that allows the summon to appear. A similar one way rift is created to send the creature back when it's unsummoned. Besides this they can differ heavily. \n The first and most widely used form of Summoning spells brings forth a spirit that takes the form of the intended summon. The type of spirit c…",

          "description": "Deep in the woods a man was tied to a tree, robbed and wounded, left to bleed out. The last thought that man had was wondering why, why he needed to die. Then he left this life behind. Not a minute later the man's eyes opened. But they weren't his eyes anymore. A being forgotten to history, awoken in a different body. The creature stood up, the ropes morphing into snakes, disappearing into the undergrowth. The thing examined it's body. Human, 5'11, 43 years old, dressed in rags. It wouldn't do.\n The air around the creature bent and distorted, and the man changed. On the outside the creature changed, bones cracked, skin tore, muscle ripped as something grew from within, reassembling the available materials. What emerged once the process was complete was something different. Thinner and taller than a human, limbs a few inches longer than they should be, rags replaced with a black and gold suit with a black and gold cape and a black and gold top hat. Much better, something was missing though. One of the snakes from earlier slithered over, around and up the leg of the creature, up the torso, down the right arm. Upon reaching the hand it changed, changing, solidifying into a black and gold cane, capped in a small crystal orb.\n Outfit complete, the creature stretched, aligning the limbs. Then the creature examined it's surroundings, deep woods, darkening sky, no one around. The creature took ten steps in a random direction, then decided to use a different method of transportation. Space bent and distorted, the creature took another step, and was in a town. Eerily similar to the one it performed in all those months ago. But unlike last time it wasn't a magician anymore. It didn't want to perform for the people anymore. It didn't know what it wanted. The creature walked to a bench, and sat down. Waiting for something or someone to talk to. It wanted to know what had happened since it departed.\n    submitted by    /u/Visible_Plastic_8109  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is project designation A-7434, the goal of the project being the creation of three autonomous individuals to help me manage my hive. I’m also using it as an opportunity to revisit some of my older experiments over using features and traits of arthropods other than spiders in my kin.\n Bodies are easy, minds are not. Luckily, spiders normally have very rudimentary brains, myself being a notable exception. Their thought process for the most part running on instincts and habits with little critical thought. \n I’m not making spiders though.
