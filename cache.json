          "description": "Last night, a swift war raged as a result of an assassination by a human terrorist cell, sponsored by west rothinus itself.\n The elven emperor of East rothinus declared war with his dying breath. His daughter, general Silverado Santana deployed nanite specialist wizards to plant grey goo bombs on the west rothinus mainland. \n Within hours of detonation, 2/3 of the west rothinus mainland was destroyed by grey goo. The west rothinites developed a secret river trench to weaponized our fail-safes. Surveillance orb images suggested an immediate grey goo counter attack was in the works, but they were trying to rebuild their arsenal after east rothinus destroyed it. \n This led to the ordering of an amphibious assault in the wee hours of the morning. The last of west rothinus was defending the arcane fabricators to their last breath. \n In the end, west rothinus fell, and the ringed gates became a protectorate of rothinus, renamed deep gate city.\n    submitted by    /u/WizardswithBlueHelms  \n [link]   [comments]",
