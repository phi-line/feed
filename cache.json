          "description": "Oriana was looking for a potion, a certain age potion to become older. While searching she found an old temple and decided to go inside to take a look.\n Going inside she casts detect magic detecting something in the middle of the temple. She starts walking towards it activating a series of traps on the way there.\n She reaches the middle of the temple with burned robes and an arrow through her hat. In the middle there's a pedestal with a potion on it, apon further inspection the potion has a label \"age giving potion\" \n Oriana: sweet!\n She takes the potion and the pedestal goes down. After it goes fully down a curse comes out in a form of mist, completely surrounding her. After a bit the mist disappears and Orioana isn't quite there anymore.\n Orion: I'm back! Let's go!\n Noiro in Orion's brain: that's nice, wait...\n Oriana in Orion's brain: what is this place? Why is it full of catgirls?\n Noiro: oh no she's here...\n Oriana: who are you? You look like me, but you're a guy\n Noiro: I'm Orion's \"evil\" version, it seems you're now stuck with me in his brain \n Oriana: I'm fine with that sweetheart~\n Noiro: noooooooooo\n Orion:aw shit, here we go again \n    submitted by    /u/Orion_gamer1  \n [link]   [comments]",
