          "description": "When most scientists talk about progress in their field, they speak about small, incremental changes that slightly, gradually improve our understanding of how the Universe works. But when we think about the biggest advances in scientific history, they often occur in revolutionary leaps, completely overthrowing our previously held views of how the Universe works. In particular, revolutions like Special Relativity and General Relativity, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, and the Big Bang and cosmic inflation completely overthrew our prior picture of how things actually behave. As the “holy grail” of physics, many have long sought a Theory of Everything, seeking to explain every particle, phenomenon, and interaction in all the Universe within a single framework, and possibly even wi…",

People have swum across the Strait, and it is easy to see from Spain to Morocco on a normal, clear day. It seems like it would not take much for nature to simply close that connection between Europe and Africa, and in so doing isolate the Mediterranean Sea. Indeed, this has happened before.\nAbout six million years ago, something caused the Mediterranean to be cut off. Perhaps it was an ice age that decreased the sea level enough to leave a land bridge between Spain and Morocco. The Mediterranean’s isolation could also have been the outcome of tectonic processes. \nIn what is dubbed the Messinian salinity crisis, the Mediterranean Sea th…",

And the high-level pattern emerging across my research is clear: longevity comes from honoring tradition while evolving slowly, and centering trust with employees and communities.\nThese lessons, I believe, hold as mu…",

          "description": "If you look at all the objects detectable in Earth’s skies, including both naturally occurring bodies as well as artificial satellites, it should come as no surprise that the Sun appears as the brightest object of all. The Sun, after all, produces its own light, sustainably powered by nuclear fusion in its core. That core-generated energy helps keep the Sun from contracting under its own gravitation, but also propagates to the Sun’s edge, the photosphere, where the Sun emits radiation over a wide range of wavelengths that correspond to a temperature of around 6000 K. Although the Moon is the second-brightest object in most wavelengths of light, it only appears so bright because of its very close proximity to Earth. From an intrinsic point of view, most of the Moon’s light is merely reflect…",

When we discovered that the Universe was expanding, the constant disappeared, eventually leading Einstein to declare it his biggest blunder.

          "description": "Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection did more than explain evolution, it revealed how complexity can emerge without a designer. Nobel laureate Paul Nurse unpacks Darwin’s insights, from the logic of tiny differences to the profound impacts these variations have on our understanding of life.\nNurse explores the deep genetic connections linking all organisms, from humans to gorillas to yeast. This shared ancestry, he argues, reframes how we think about responsibility: If all life is related, what do we owe to the living world?\nThis video The history of natural selection, in 7 minutes is featured on Big Think.",

          "description": "Is all of modern theoretical physics pointless? If you listen to any one of a number of disillusioned high-energy physicists (or wannabe physicists), you might conclude that it is. After all, the 20th century was a century of theoretical triumphs: we were able, on both subatomic and cosmic scales, to at last make sense of the Universe that surrounded and comprised us. We figured out what the fundamental forces and interactions governing physics were, what the fundamental constituents of matter were, how they assembled to form the world we observe and inhabit, and how to predict what the results of any experiment performed with those quanta would be.\nCombined, the Standard Model of elementary particles and the standard model of cosmology represent the culmination of 20th century physics.

          "description": "What if the secret to a happier life wasn’t constant joy, but something far more balanced?\nPsychiatrist Robert Waldinger, MD, psychologist Tal Ben-Shahar, PhD, and author-entrepreneur Peter Baumann share what 85 years of research and lived experience reveal about happiness. They explain why chasing it directly often backfires—and how strong relationships, mindfulness, and embracing every emotion can build a baseline of positivity that actually lasts. \nWe created this video for Brain Briefs, a Big Think interview series created in partnership with Unlikely Collaborators. As a creative non-profit organization, they’re on a mission to help people challenge their perceptions and expand their thinking. Often that growth can start with just a single unlikely question that makes you rethink your convictions and adjust your vantage point.

          "description": "It’s amazing how far we’ve come, scientifically, in the span of only ten years. Back in 2015, humanity didn’t know whether a core prediction of Einstein’s general relativity — the existence of energy-carrying gravitational waves — was true or not. We had theoretical predictions that these waves should be generated whenever a massive object moved and accelerated through a changing gravitational field, and we had observed orbital decay of binary systems (like binary pulsars) that were consistent with those predictions, but the ripples in spacetime themselves, or gravitational waves, had never been directly detected. For 100 years, this great prediction of physics remained unconfirmed.\nThen, on September 14, 2015, all of that changed. The twin LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Obs…",
