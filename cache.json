But Kavrala's oil corruption arc has ended!\n I've been waiting to share this art for around two months now! There's gonna be plenty more to come! And you KNOW I'll be drawing more dragons! The Sanctuary is coming back and it'll be more diverse than ever!\n All in all, this is just a thank you to everyone who participated in my story arc. Being able to interact with you all as our characters; It makes everything worth it, especially when I agonize over how a sentence sounds or how a drawing looks, lol.\n So to everyone, whether we've spoken to each other or not, thank you.\n It's kinda crazy to think that I've been on the sub for three years now. I look back at my first ever post on here and can't even believe that Kavrala used to not exist, and that she almost had four arms at one point!\n I love this community.\n Ah, regardless, Kav is no longer an oily abomination! She's been cleansed and has some slight amnesia!! I plan on doing posts for her recovery and also to cleanse the land that got destroyed during the arc as well!\n Ah, and enjoy some extra art too, why not?\n    submitted by    /u/Traxxya  \n [link]   [comments]",
