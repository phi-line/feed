          "description": "(Image Source: Jurassic Park)\n The presence of mega-flora was a new experience for Kardonk, not to mention the existence of mega-fauna. He spend several days trying to decide if he should venture from the beach and risk it in the jungle’s muggy terrain. In the end, a need for fresh water drove him into the greenery.\n The Paleomancer, it seems, had taken some ill-advised shining to Hazema. This Kardonk knew, but believed the amicability between the two of them, plus the promise to attempt to free the Paleomancer from Hellfire had been enough to smooth over that difference, at least until the day that Kardonk chose to again seek conflict with the Tyrant of Drakeem.\n He had been mistaken. After an attempt to get Kardonk to foreswear any violence against Hazema, and Kardonk’s refusal to swear to such a thing provided she continued to terrorize the surrounding nations, The Paleomancer managed to trick him to and island 80 million years in the past under the guise of discussing his contract in a place where Hellfire could not possibly overhear. \n Now, without a way home, Kardonk was forced to hunt for his survival. The first thing he learned was that it took a terrifying number of bullets to take down a Tyrannosaur. The second thing he learned was that he had no way to keep the meat, at least not as it stood. The vast majority of the carcass was devoured by carrion or spoiled within a manner of days.\n He determined quickly that he needed a fire. This was not overly difficult between the collection of fallen limbs and the sacrifice of some of his now precious gunpowder. The difficult part was learning enough of the science of fire making to keep the flame burning perpetually, in rain or in heat.\n Soon he had a large blaze going on the beach, shielded by a stone and wood structure from the wind and rain. Phase one of the plan was complete.\n Now he just needed to wrangle a Deinonychus.\n    submitted by    /u/LimpPrior6366  \n [link]   [comments]",

The Nurglite warriors’ footfalls can be heard for miles up and down the valley, and the reek of decaying flesh carries even further on the wind. Tamurkhan rides at the head of the enormous horde atop the toad dragon Bubebolos, followed by his lieutenants and elite warriors from each of his Infector Cohorts. Without warning, he raises his fist, signaling for the march to halt. Warband leaders copy the gesture all the way down the line, despite their confusion. Why has Tamurkhan chosen to stop here?\n When the cacophonous sound of steel-shod boots pounding against the earth dies away, the Maggot Lord and his mount tur…",
