I have recently reached the conclusion that a theocratic monarchy is problematic as it puts most people down. A truly perfect society is one where the weakest can thrive. This is the reason why Drakeem will from now on be a social-democracy!\"\n \"Instead of mass producing soldiers our clone plants will instead pump out doctors, farmers and social workers! Education will become a big focus instead of war or trade. Trade will be abolished entirely due to the inherently corrupt nature of the capitalistic system and we will work hard to help the workers revolution in other nations around the world.\"\n \"Furthermore we will enforce a 4 day workweek and expand unionization. The first election will be held in half a year. During that time the legislature will work on the constitution and me and my colleagues will work hard to make sure the transfer of power is swift and peaceful. Last but not least we will sign the international treaty forbidding the use of certain magic's especially during wartime.\"\n \"That is all!\"\n The first president of Drakeem leaves the stage under thunderous applause as the former empire turns over a new leaf\n /uw Happy April 1st!

The shadow cast from his hat obscured his eyes, but what one could see from his poker face was that he seemed unnaturally calm.\n A small group stared fearfully at the locked door as if some monster was going to burst through at any moment. This group was composed of one newly elected councillor and a few of her aides. Another individual sat next to the terrified group, but it was hard to tell anything about them.
