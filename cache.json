The Northern lights glowed in the cloudless night sky amongst the moon as they reflected from frozen puddles of ice.. \n However as one reached a downhill, they would've been met by an onsen, in midst of nowhere, but seemed to have some activity as there were lights on as the wind had calmed down. As one entered the onsen, they were welcomed by warmth and smell of burning pine and sense of rest. But then a woman appeared from behind some curtains in a kimono with diamond patterns, her hair was white, as it flew behind her back over kimono, her eyes golden, a big and fluffy tail showed itself from beneath the kimono behind her, her fox ears twitched on top of her head. \n \"Ah, customers..\" \n a warm smile appeared over her face.\n \"There havent been many customers for centuries,baths are open, rooms open. Would you like to rest and relax here before you continue your journeys?\"\n The kitsune asked with welcoming and warm smile..\n    submitted by    /u/Purpleparentcake  \n [link]   [comments]",
