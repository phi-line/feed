No other voice in his head either.\n he was just, walking, on a cold, ashen, ground, for what felt like months. Though in actuality it had only been a few minutes, he didn’t know.\n looking closely, వ saw faint red dust in the air, neon in color. Core radiation. What had happened here? Not like he knew. \n So, he walked. For what felt like eternity\n At one point, he thought he saw a cliff in the distance, in this, endless, deserted, gravel landscape, but after blinking a few times, it was gone.\n Eventually, he found something. A small hatch in the ground, only barely covered up by the dust on the ground\n “Finally, something”\n flipping open the hatch, వ descends a stairway. It’s a dusty space, filled primarily with monitors. Powered by, a battery? Seems it can run for a while.\n powering it up, it booted up to a log-on screen of, Calarakis?\n “Oh, I remember now.” he said aloud, as he unlocked the computer. It led to a backup of various files from throughout the city. Latest dating to… doesn’t even know how long ago. It’s been just, walking, for so long that the day had been forgotten. Checking the system time led it to… today? No, that can’t be right.\n Click-click.\n it’s a shot of the inside of the Core system, it showcases readings on the left. Instability, graphs overloading, then-\n white\n the camera dies.\n “So. If the world isn’t dead, I’m still probably going to die here. I can’t cast any magic with this in the air. How did I even get here? How did I survive?”\n deciding to focus on more pragmatic efforts, he comes to the obvious conclusion.\n “Very little chance I’m going to be seen. Probably would’ve been found by now if I have.”\n he sulks into the chair, as it creaks with him leaning backward.\n /uw all of this is a dream, if your character can enter dreams, they can find him. Ж’s currently wandering, just like in the other post.\n    submitted by    /u/Fc-chungus  \n [link]   [comments]",

He stared at Calarakis, at least, what was left of it. Which, wasn’t much. Evidentially the core system had detonated, he felt it. The antimagic in the air, almost, oppressive. All that was left was a crater, nearly 1000 feet deep by the looks of it. He saw the zero point floating in the middle of the crater, high above anything else.\n “This… can’t be real.”\n but it certainly felt like it. He could feel the Individual grass blades and the dirt under his feet.\n then something was noticed, that voice, వ’s, where was it? He had been completely alone here, no one else had said anything.\n then he turned around.\n …",

          "description": "inside his workshop Thrak is concentrating on his work forging something only this time he's using unusual materials in the process. At different points in the process he adds another material to the infant weapon first a few yellow flowers then two jars one with a golden liquid the other with what seems to be wind. When the weapon begins to take shape into that of a sword he adds three more a talon,a claw and a fang setting them towards the edge and tip of the blade.\n Finally when the weapon has taken shape but before it was cooled he takes two final items one a strange red crystal that he breaks and sprinkles across the blade. Finally the last item an eerie red gem that seems to pulse that he places firmly within the center of the guard. With all the items used and the blade ready Thrak carefully lifts the blade with tongs and lowers it into a bucket filled with a black liquid to cool it. Taking the blade out and drying it reveals a black longsword with a red gem embedded into the guard\n    submitted by    /u/totallynotrobboss  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is my last post on WP and its related subs. For the related chats I am in I will stay in as I like the community behind them very much.
