          "description": "Atriox was disgruntled. He hadn’t had a good idea in a while. So he stretched and decided to visit his hoard, something that rarely happened these days. He hadn’t long lost his lust for gold and silver and other precious metals due to his being an earth dragon that could simply call the metals out of the earth on a whim. Still he kept it around for sentimental reasons.\n As the colossal dragon strode through the cavern his eyes paused on one of the more odd and disdainful pieces in his hoard, an Orb of Dragonkind. The orb was a weapon that wizards had crafted to trap and kill his kind. It made him snarl in rage at the thought and swept past. How would those upstart mages like it if they were… if they were…\n Atriox’s fangs bared themselves in a malicious grin.\n Thre Days Later\n An orb puts out a call. It has all the answers to the questions that wizards have asked for millennia as well as answers to questions that were never thought to be asked. For a thousand miles in every direction magic users feel the orb’s wisdom and secrets whispering to them. And they feel compelled to come to the peak of the mountain where it rests.\n Far below Atriox grins in wait, ready to trigger the ancient volcano that had been dormant for hundreds of thousands of years. he just had to wait a little while longer for the Orb of Wizardkind to do its job of luring them in.\n    submitted by    /u/AtrioxCalamity  \n [link]   [comments]",

Back when Riva had tried to cede power back to Ithacar itself. \n But giving up that control had proven far harder than Riva had expected, given all the threats the outside world contained. And since Ithacar had been the site of some of events, people seemed to like to go back to bother it. Frankly, the only reason Riva had come back as Queen at all was to ensure her home didn’t promptly get destroyed again. At the time, she had been the only one who knew the Wards at all. The last one who did. \n But she had sworn an Oath to Ithacar too. To protect it. Preserve it. To take up arms in its defense, and not destroy the ruling body without cause.

          "description": "Reconstruct Writings is a restorative spell that returns a piece of text to its original state. This includes what it was written on and what it was written in. The spell will attempt to bring together the original materials but if they are destroyed or too far apart it will replace them with magical matter at a higher mana cost. The amount of damage and the age of said damage change the effectiveness of this spell. The more damaged and the older said damage negatively affects the spells effectiveness. Resulting in progressively less legible results. \n It's a minor spell, capable of being easily cast by most apprentices to repair paper but its usefulness is not to be understated. Any mage in a profession interacting with text should learn it. I can't tell you the amount of books I've been able to save from the consequences of a misfortunate or reckless situation with this spell alone. It has also served me greatly in archival purposes keeping decade old books and manuscripts in top condition. It's great at fixing important documents if you just so happen to spill tea over them as well\n Like many spells we take for granted despite its simple casting the inner workings of the spell are surprisingly complex, built upon many hundreds of years of magical developments. If you were to break it down, the spell requires minor oracling to identify the original components and their construction, tracking magic to find the component in the present, telekinetic magic to bring them together, transmutational magic to form It back to its original state, and finally conjuration magic to fill in any potential gaps. All of that and more has been wrapped up into an easily castable spell. So simple even a novice can use it. Every spell truly is a wonder if you only look a little deeper.\n    submitted by    /u/Lilith_Anorthosite  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not sure what kind of tree but it's definitely a nice hard wood. I peeled and dried it. Then I shaped it to my liking with a draw knife, rasps, and belt sanders. Once I was happy with its shape, I hand sanded it up to 2000 grit(probably overkill). It's 3.5 ft long and is made like an axe or mattock handle and it's weight and mass distribution are similar. So it's very comfortable in the hand and can be easily swung like an axe. Then I made a stain with 30% acetic acid/vinegar, steel wool, and black tea. Wiped it down good with the stain. Let it dry. Then sanded it again and repeated until I got the color I wanted. Finally I finished it with a layer of wax. What do you think?\n    submitted by    /u/Metawakening  \n [link]   [comments]",
