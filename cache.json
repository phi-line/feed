He then though realized he had stuff to do and couldn't hold the position, so he got the idea to hire someone and made posters about it.\n After a day or two someone approached, it was a human, who by his appearance looked like a bard. He seemed pretty legit though his footing was really unsteady.\n Orion: hey there are you here for the job?\n ???: yes I am, I'm Charlie a human bard\n Orion: and you're fine with your only payment being food and shelter?\n Charlie: actually yes w- I am \n Orion: eh, no one else came anyways so you're hired \n As you walk through a forest in the empire of boom directly under Atriox's land you see the stand.\n    submitted by    /u/Orion_gamer1  \n [link]   [comments]",

I haven't really shown this to anybody and it has some lore behind its creation. So here it is.\n The stone was given to me by one of my predecessors as he moved on. He said his predecessor had found it and crafted it into a necklace by fashioning a hole into it. And then my predecessor had engraved runes from a foreign land(chinese letters) onto it which read \"lucky stone\".
