          "description": "/uw If you want context, see here and here, as well as optionally here. Aside from this, just know that Kyrona’s mentor is an assassin who’s also a Druid. \n /rw Kyrona sat in a library in her city that was the manifestation of the mind of an strange immortal being. The library grew on its own, and filled with knowledge collected by the creature. Technically it wasn’t the safest space to go after a shouting match with one’s mentor, but it would do so long as she kept it fed with informational books. The library was bent solely on the gathering of knowledge, regardless of the morality of its attempts to do so, though its selection sometimes seemed lacking. It had only a single chapter on Druids in the whole of its thousands of books on billions of shelves, but that paled in comparison to the two footnotes they had on artificers.\n The ever moving walkways of the library drifted towards the back again, taking Kyrona with them, trying to close the bookshelves around her. The 15-year old Druid tossed it a cookbook, and the library abated, satisfied. \n Her girlfriend, Sapphire came in just then. “I have bad news and I have worse news. Which do you want to hear first?” “The bad news.” “The bad news is that my secret’s out. The worse news is that your mentor just framed you for 17 different murders. He might also have been behind my secret being out, he did find out about it.” Kyrona fumed. Did he do this because she had yelled at him? Was he truly that petty. Perhaps Kyrona needed to have a chat with her mentor. She prepared as many offensive spells as she could, and then ran after him. He would pay for this.\n    submitted by    /u/sparkle3364  \n [link]   [comments]",
