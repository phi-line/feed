But by year’s end the mood had shifted. The dot-com crash had drained Silicon Valley’s exuberance, Napster was being dismantled in court, and the new wave of post-9/11 “warblogs” made the internet feel solemn and overly serious. Meanwhile, Microsoft continued its dominance over the web with the release of Internet Explorer 6.\nDespite the doom and gloom, 2001 was also a year in which the web continued to mature. It gained a memory through Wikipedia and the Wayback Machine, discovered new voices through blogs and communities like MetaFilter, and began to legitmately shake up the cultural industries with iTunes and the iP…",

Frozen spinach saves me this heartache, and here we’re using a whole box, saving us a math headache too.\nRead more »",

The second is the Opera Cake (Gâteau Opéra), a stacked and striped dessert with thin almond cake layers soaked in espresso syrup, chocolate ganache, and a rich espresso buttercream. The difference between the first cake and the second is that the second recipe was never going to happen.\n\nIn the nearly two decades of Smitten Kitchen’s existence, I’ve again and again begun researching what a homemade opera cake would entail and every time, slammed the proverbial book shut because it was just too much. A joconde! French buttercream! Soaking syrup! Chocolate layer! Many separated eggs! And what about all of that espresso? There are children present! And elderly people (me) who probably shouldn’t drink coffee after 4pm! If I could barely talk myself into it, how would I convince you? Maybe some things are best left to the professionals, I concluded.\nRead more »",

It’s given me such a great sense of freedom and clarity that I was thinking: I should do the same for my recipes. This one, for example, I would file under “magic”, because it comes together (mostly) from the store-cupboard, both in that easy way in which you throw things into a pot until they alchemise, but also because tahini and beans, together with a lemon, can, magically, become the most soothing antidote to cold weather.\nJoin Meera Sodha at a special event celebrating the best of Guardian culture on Wednesday 26 November, hosted by Nish Kumar and alongside writers Stuart Heritage and Tim Dowling, with Georgina Lawton hosting You be the judge live.

He took them camping and on cycling trips, and he raved about them to friends. Slowly, they became a pantry staple for us. When I have the time, I like to batch-cook my own curry sauce and freeze it, but when there isn’t time, we love this meal. It feels embarrassingly easy to make, because the cubes bring all the flavour, and also quite fancy at the same time thanks to the egg yolk.

          "description": "Spiced fried seasonal vegetables folded through basmati rice and served with a nutty, raita-style dressing\nMy mother’s greatest fears are an empty fridge and underfed family and friends. That’s why there’s always a glut of fresh produce in the kitchen, both hers and mine – like mother, like daughter. At this time of year, that means courgettes, and the usual way I dispatch them is in a shaak (dry curry) or a pilau. Today’s dish is a combination of the two: spiced fried courgettes, just shy of melted, tossed through rice with fresh herbs and served with a fancy salted pistachio yoghurt masquerading as a raita.\n Continue reading...",

Others, such as this one, are more challenging. But imagine this: seared aubergines cooked with sweet onions and tomatoes, spiced with aromatics such as cardamom, chilli, mustard seeds and smoky curry leaves, then melted into a pot with rice, water and time, until wetter than a risotto but less homogeneous than a congee. A perfect meal to cook on a cool summer’s evening to slow yourself down, both to stoke an appetite and to warm the belly.\n Continue reading...",

They saw themselves as unusually clear-headed and logical — people determined to build a society based on reason rather than on the accidents of tradition. If there was a better way to do something, they wanted to find it.\nAt first, the experiment went smoothly. They shared work, rotated responsibilities, and debated policy late into the night. But before long, they started to complain about English. It’s irrational, they said. Silent letters everywhere, no phonetic consistency, spelling rules that dissolve the moment you learn them. Why do “though,” “through,” and “tough” all look the same but sound nothing alike? And the idioms! Why should “kick the bucket” mean “die”? Surely a truly rational society can do better, they though…",

That not only includes the resources we typically think of, like minerals, clean water, and breathable air, but also something even more fundamental and restrictive: land area. No matter how thoroughly we develop, there’s only a finite amount of land area to even potentially inhabit on our planet. Even if we built cities atop our existing cities, beneath them in subterranean passages, or floating atop the oceans, the fact is we’re living on a planet with a finite area and a finite volume, fundamentally limiting our ability to expand. \nEven if we develop floating cities, the finite surface area of planet Earth ensures that, beyond a certa…",

Laughter is a noun with many possible adverbs. This raises a problem for anyone wanting to tell a joke. Because a joke, at its most basic, is something that is intended to make someone laugh. And so, given the sheer variety of laughter, it makes sense that there’s an equally sheer variety of jokes. A joke might be good-natured or mean. It might be childish or intellectual. It might be universal or niche. It might be about a social norm or about a specific person. Different jokes for different laughter.\nThe philosophy of humor is such an ill-defined and borderless discipline that a writer would be foolish to try to say anything meaningful at all.

I realized I’d been unconsciously filtering ideas through “does this make me look clever?” instead of “will this help the reader?”\nOnce I noticed I was optimizing for the wrong outcome, I could change it.

It was called Liber Abaci, The Book of Calculations, and in it Fibonacci set out algebraic principles that, essentially, enabled merchants to make money. He had the journalistic gift of making the strange seem commonplace and the tangential seem relevant. By posing real-life examples of conundrums faced by traders, Fibonacci brought maths to life. Had he written in the language of the academy, the book would have had limited relevance. But because he wrote it for the merchants, Fibonacci revealed the true genius of the…",

The only absolute, Einstein contended, was the speed of light in a vacuum. This was indeed a revolutionary statement, but the formulas for working out how distances and durations changed in a velocity-dependent way, especially as you approached the speed of light, had already been worked out over a decade prior: the Lorentz transformations.\nAnd yet, Einstein’s key insights, and the profundity of Special Rela…",

From the role of slaves in dressing elites to the rowdy crowds at chariot races, she shows how we’ve underestimated their complexity.\nThis video The truth of Ancient Rome hides under its myth of decadence is featured on Big Think.",

This simple fact has led to an enormous suite of subsequent discoveries: the hot Big Bang, the cosmic microwave background, the growth of the large-scale structure of the Universe over cosmic time, and much more. It’s also led to a profound existential question: how will the Universe end? If it’s expanding, which it is, and the expansion rate has decreased over time, which the evidence also supports, then what will happen in the far future? Will the expansion continue forever? Will it continue to decrease, or will it increase again? And if it does decrease, will it ever drop to zero and then, afterwards, reverse itself?\nT…",

Around 500 years ago, there was really only one scientific phenomenon that was, without controversy, extremely well-understood: the motion of the celestial objects in the sky. The Sun rose in the east and set in the west with a regular, 24 hour period. Its path in the sky rose higher and the days grew longer until the summer solstice, while its path was the lowest and shortest on the winter solstice: part of the annual cycle. The motions of the stars also exhibited a similar 24 hour period, as though the heavenly canopy rotated throughout the night. The Moon migrated night-to-night relative to the other objects by about 12° as it changed its phases, while …",

And so, the rails evolved into flightless versions. Why waste effort and energy on flying when there’s no point?\nThen came a catastrophic flood. The island went underwater.

He and his team collected stories of awe from 26 countries, identifying eight universal sources of this emotion shared across humanity, from moral beauty to collective effervescence. Even one minute of awe per day, he explains, can help us heal loneliness, grief, and even physical ailments. \nAt A Night of Awe & Wonder, hosted by Big Think and the John Templeton Foundation, Keltner invites all of us to rediscover awe, a force for connection and healing in our modern lives.\nThis video Why Einstein called awe the fundamental emotion is featured on Big Think.",

We measured the distance to these galaxies, determining that the farther away they were, on average, the faster they appeared to be speeding away from us. And we calculated that a Universe that was uniformly filled with “stuff” — whether matter, radiation, a cosmological constant, or any other form of energy — would be unable to be static and stable; it must either expand or contract.\nFrom these revolutionary realizations, the notion of the expanding Universe was born.

When we applied Einstein’s equations to the entire Universe as a whole, along with the idea that the Universe was filled nearly uniformly with matter and energy on the largest scales, we wound up with an expanding Universe. Extrapolating back in time, we arrived at a very hot, dense, and uniform early state, where all of the Universe’s matter and energy was concentrated into a tiny, minuscule volume.\nAnd yet, if we …",

It is the reason why most cultures believe in a soul of some kind — an entity distinct from the body that experiences its sensations and beliefs.\nScience, too, has generally seen this border as impenetrable. The great German mathematician Gottfried Leibniz used the famous “mill argument”: If there was, he wrote in 1714, “a machine whose structure makes it think, sense, and have perceptions,” then you could imagine enlarging it to a size of a mill and walking into it — but all you’d be able to see is parts that push one another, and no amount of detail could explain how all of that converts into actual thinking and perceiving.\nIn the mid-20th century, this wisdom was considered so unshakeable that an entire tradit…",

More than half a million years ago, the first fungi, plants, and animals appeared, leading to a planet whose continents and oceans were overrun with large, complex, differentiated organisms.

They were planned to be mules for a permanent lunar base by 1981, propulsion systems for deep space probes to Jupiter, Saturn, and the outer planets, and engines for “space tugs” and shuttles ferrying payloads and people from low Earth orbit (LEO) to space stations around the Earth and the Moon.

We’re talking about all the evolutionary quirks that humans tend to exploit — the cases where we’re “built” for one purpose, but decide to put that structure to other uses. And masturbation is a classic example.\nIn this week’s Mini Philosophy interview, I spoke with Slingerland about his book Drunk, in which he outlines his “intoxication thesis.” Slingerland argues it’s quite common to think that getting drunk is an evolutionary mistake. Some early Homo sapiens drank too much fermented fruit juice and discovered it was pretty fun. So they told their mates and, altogether, they clinked their frothy ciders and sang bawdy songs about hunting and gathering. But the human brain and body were not built to get drunk. …",

Starting in the 1960s, the Big Bang’s greatest predictions were confirmed, leading to widespread acceptance of the theory. However, a few unexplained puzzles remained, leading scientists to question whether the most extreme predictions of the Big Bang, including arbitrarily high temperatures and an origin from a singularity, were actually correct.\nIn the early 1980s, a revolutionary new theory was proposed, …",

Galaxies are larger, more massive, more evolved, and are richer in stars but fewer in number than they were back in the early stages of cosmic history. By looking farther and farther away, we can see the Universe as it was at earlier times, but we’re going to be limited in many ways: by how deep our telescopes can see, by what wavelengths they’re capable of seeing, and by what small fraction of the sky they’re capable of observing.\n\n\n\nThat’s why an observing program like COSMOS-Web, the largest, widest-field JWST observing program to date, is so important. It isn’t just revealing galaxies as they are nearby (at late times), at a variety of intermediate distances (and earlier times), and at ultra-large distances (and the earliest times of all), but due to its wide-field nature, is revealing galaxy types of varying abundances: the common-type galaxies, galaxies that are representative of more uncommon varieties, and even significant numbers of rare galaxies. And it’s this aspect of galaxy evolution that makes me so proud and lucky to welcome Dr. Olivia Cooper to the podcast.\n\n\n\nOlivia is a recently-minted PhD who works as part of the COSMOS-Web team, specializing in galaxy evolution and using JWST data — along with data from other world-class observatories — to investigate how the galaxies in our Universe grew up, and what that can teach us about our own cosmic past.

Evolution works in similar ways, so thoroughly destroying what doesn’t work that what’s left over tends to work quite well. Or think about health: What foods are good for you is an endless debate, and no one who’s honest with the evidence can say they know the perfect diet. But what’s bad for you is much more settled.

In Lisbon, the former Portuguese finance minister Paulo Portas put it bluntly: “If Europe doesn’t innovate, it will become the museum of the world.”\nThis week’s Noema essay by Nathan Gardels captures that tension perfectly — the growing divide between America’s accelerationism and Europe’s caution. In the U.S., billions are pouring into AI infrastructure; in Europe, the focus remains on ethics, transparency, and control.\nGardels argues that both approaches are necessary: America’s restless innovation pushes humanity forward, while Europe’s restraint ensures progress remains humane. “AI differs from nuclear weapons because it is a foundational technol…",

The stars, shining brightly throughout the sky, will all someday burn out; the galaxies will someday turn dark. Even if the timescales for some of these phenomena are barely fathomable to the human mind, the fact remains that everything within the Universe, and even the Universe itself, will someday cease to exist as we know it.\nBut has science truly learned enough to declare what the nature of our ultimate cosmic demise will be?

The speed of light, even though it’s the fastest speed that any signal can travel throughout the Universe, is still finite. No matter how close or distant an object is, you’re only seeing it as it was a particular amount of time ago: at the moment the now-arriving light was emitted from the object you’re observing. The fact that light has to travel through space, from the emitted object to the observer that sees it, explains why there’s a gap that we have to fill in through inference alone.\nEvery observer in the Universe, so long as they haven’t spent a large amount of time traveling close to the speed of light (or in an extraordinarily large gravitation…",

Although this empties the Universe and stretches it flat, it also contains quantum fluctuations superimposed atop it: fluctuations that will later provide the seeds for cosmic structure within our own Universe. What happened before the final ~10^-32 seconds of inflation, including the question of whether inflation arose from a singular state before it, not only isn’t known, but may…",

These stretched light waves are a consequence of the expanding Universe, and they are nearly, but not quite, identical for galaxies that we see in all directions in space.\nDoes that difference, and the fact that one direction has a slightly greater redshift for its objects than the opposite direction, tell us anything about where, all those billions of years ago, the Big Bang actu…",

To everyone else, he was “Big Ed,” a larger-than-life physician who was a magician, an archer, a raconteur, and much else. By day, he mesmerized patients with his easy confidence; by night, he dazzled guests with sleight-of-hand, conjuring coins from behind ears or producing endless scarves from his sleeve. To me, he was both healer and illusionist, a scientist and showman.\nWhen your father is a magician, what do you believe? As a child, the boundary between real and unreal was porous.

The other was Seqenenra Taa II, ruler of the simultaneous and rival 17th Dynasty, based down in Thebes. One day, Apepi sent a messenger south to Thebes to convey a complaint and an instruction to Seqenenra. \nApepi claimed that he was being kept awake at night by ‘the hippopotami from the swamp … in the eastern waters of the city [of Thebes], because they do not allow that sleep come to me, day or night, because their noise is in his ear!’ Seqenenra…",

But absurdism and existentialism are not the same.\nIn this week’s Mini Philosophy interview, I spoke with the philosopher and writer Laura Kennedy about Camus.

Mainlined into humanity’s daily maelstrom of data, Dataminr detects events “on average 5 hours ahead of the Associated Press” — it picked up the 2024 Baltimore bridge collapse, for example, about an hour ahead of all mainstream media sources. The accuracy rate of its “news” is, says Gumbel, a highly impressive 99.5%.\nOn top of that, the company’s AI systems, built on proprietary LLMs, analyze real-time events at such unprecedented speed that whole new strata of planning and strategy become possible.

Even as a child, Gall was fascinated by the brain and its connection with people’s personalities, and so throughout his career, he intensely studied its anatomy while also gathering data on people’s skull sizes and facial features.\nHe came to believe that people’s mental faculties were localized within specific brain regions. And because these regions molded the shape of people’s skulls, a trained eye could divinate a person’s capabilities for love, violence, greed, intelligence, and other traits simply by examining their cranial bumps and recessions.\nAs you’ve probably guessed, Gall’s hypotheses provided the basis for phrenology — though Ga…",

Similar to architectural blueprints or circuit diagrams, these standardized templates provide simplified overviews of complex organizations, and can be used to turn an ailing company around, or design a healthy one from the ground up.\nFirst developed by business theorist Alex Osterwalder and computer scientist Yves Pigneur in the early 2000s as part of Osterwalder’s PhD thesis, the BMC framework has since developed into one of the most well-known and widely used business modeling tools on the planet, embedding itself in MBA curricula and guiding decision-making processes in C-suites and incubators alike.\nIn addition to authoring several bestselling books on …",

Even with the advantage of large, powerful telescopes, even from far above the limitations of Earth’s atmosphere in space, there are still enormous portions of the Universe that are virtually invisible to our optical telescopes. The reason why? Because enormous portions of the Universe are blocked by cosmic dust: small, cold grains of atom-based matter that absorb and block the visible wavelengths of light that human eyes have adapted to see. They obscure enormous regions of the galactic plane, and hinder our ability to observe star-forming regions, planet-forming disks, and objects that lie behind and beyond the plane of the Milky Way.\nSure, we’ve developed many techniques, like multi-wavelength astronomy (pa…",

          "description": "When most of us think about science, we don’t often think about something very fundamental to the enterprise: what the goal of it all actually is. Reality is a complicated place, and the only tools we have to guide us in understanding what it is and how it works is the combination of what we can observe, measure, and experiment on. When we add up the full suite of that body of observational and experimental knowledge, we have a record of all the phenomena that we know exists. The enterprise of science, then, seeks to make sense of all of it, and to explain it as simply and powerfully as possible: to maximize our predictive power of nature’s phenomena with as few assumptions, parameters, and variables as are absolutely necessary.\nWe’ve come incredibly far in our understanding of the Univers…",

          "description": "It’s hard to believe, but it was only back in the early 1990s that we discovered the very first planet orbiting a star other than our own Sun. Fast forward to the present day, here in 2025, and we’re closing in on 6000 confirmed exoplanets, found and measured through multiple techinques: the transit method, the stellar wobble method, and even direct imaging. That last one is so profoundly exciting because it gives us hope that, someday soon, we might be able to take direct images of Earth-like worlds, some of which may even be inhabited.\n\n\n\nAlthough it may be a long time before we can get an exoplanet image as high-resolution as even the ultra-distant “pale blue dot” photo that Voyager took of Earth so many decades ago, the fact remains that science is advancing rapidly, and things that seemed impossible mere decades ago now reflect today’s reality. And the people driving this fascinating field forward the most are the mostly unheralded workhorses of the fields of physics and astronomy: the early-career researchers, like grad students and postdocs, who are just beginning to establish themselves as scientists.\n\n\n\nIn this fascinating conversation with Dr. Kielan Hoch of Space Telescope Science Institute, we take a long walk at the current frontiers of science and peek over the horizon: looking at the good, the bad, and the ugly of what we’re facing here in 2025. It’s a conversation that might make you hopeful, angry, and optimistic all at the same time.

In particular, revolutions like Special Relativity and General Relativity, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, and the Big Bang and cosmic inflation completely overthrew our prior picture of how things actually behave.

That core-generated energy helps keep the Sun from contracting under its own gravitation, but also propagates to the Sun’s edge, the photosphere, where the Sun emits radiation over a wide range of wavelengths that correspond to a temperature of around 6000 K. Although the Moon is the second-brightest object in most wavelengths of light, it only appears so bright because of its very close proximity to Earth.

And they don’t have a plan to ensure humans’ ability to advocate for their rights and interests, which will go to zero soon after their economic leverage goes to zero.”\nAnd how does our economic leverage go to zero?

It might seem strange, but I’d just read an excerpt in history class, and it had sounded like perfect reading for any young person looking to make their way in the world. There’s a lot of pragmatic wisdom in The Prince, all focused on achieving significant leadership goals. However, as the critics of its time so succinctly put it, one key message of the book is that, when it comes to leadership, “the ends justify the means.” Although it is now often regarded as an outdated manual for acquiring and maintaining power, some of the utilitarian conclusions that Machiavelli draws are very similar to how outcome-oriented leaders rationalize their achievements…",

Space is vast, with the closest star located four light years away. Even a simple radio signal, which travels at the fastest speed possible, will take eight years to make a round trip.\nThe idea that there is a maximum speed is pretty counterintuitive; after all, in everyday experience, you can make a car go faster simply by stepping harder on the gas or upgrading to a sports car.

Initially, Einstein introduced the notion of a cosmological constant — a form of energy inherent to the fabric of space itself — to prevent a matter-filled Universe from collapsing. When we discovered that the Universe was expanding, the constant disappeared, eventually leading Einstein to declare it his biggest blunder. Then in the 1990s, a surprising collection of data indicated that the Universe’s expansion was accelerating, a discovery that revived the cosmological constant. The combination of supernova, cosmic microwave background, and large-scale structure data all appeared to demand it.\nBut now, more than 25 years later, an interesting set of…",
