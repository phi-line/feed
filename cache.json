          "description": "After catching wind of the child murder, the blue helmets set up a crime scene, and exhumed the body for necromantic conversation and autopsy. This was met with significant resistance but we were able to distract with enough reinforcement.\n Name: Jane Doe Sex: female Age: 12 Pre-existing conditions: none\n Findings:\n The suspect held Jane Doe by the top of the head, then closed their hand with extreme force, causing Jane Doe's skull then head to be near liquefied from the pressure. Then Jane Doe fell several hundred meters, landing on her back, But she was obviously dead before that.\n Attempts at repairing the soul has proven unsuccessful so necromantic conversation is impossible at this time.\n Reconstruction of the face has yielded inconclusive results about Jane Doe's identity.\n We could not find matching dental records or matching DNA or mana print profiles to identify the child.\n The child was found in a deep unmarked grave next to the crime scene. The headstone read \"here lies the one I failed to protect\"\n DNA and mana print profile testing for the suspect are currently ongoing. Prime suspect is a being we fought, about waist hight, resembling a blonde maid with twin pigtails wearing a pink maid uniform. They appear to be a mana a.i. construct.\n The being escaped before we could capture them.\n An image of the suspect at large is provided in the third slide.\n If you have any information regarding this case please reach out as soon as possible. \n    submitted by    /u/WizardswithBlueHelms  \n [link]   [comments]",
