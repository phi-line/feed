She sat the calligraphy brush down on her desk and started folding the strips of paper into artful manikins. The figure held each manikin in her fingers and wisps of smoke came from them. The manikins burst into flames, quickly burning through each of them. From the ashes, two new female humanoids emerged. They had black hair that was neatly tied behind their heads and wore plain white kimono. Their expressions were completely neutral as well. All in all, they possessed no remarkable features, essentially perfect blank slates.\n The figure stood up from the floor and opened the shutters. She turned back to her shikigami…",

The ancient Nurglite champion Tamurkhan has arisen in the far south, rallying the malevolent Vashar civilization to his banner with promises of deicide and revenge against magekind. The Maggot Lord plans to conquer the magical world as an offering to the Plaguelord so that he can at last ascend as a daemon prince and claim the legendary Throne of Chaos. Yet hope endures, for a Vasharan defector named Ashurhaddon Ka’al has brought us vital information concerning Tamurkhan’s warhost. Combined with our own auguries, we have managed to get a rough idea of the doctrine and organization of his forces well ahead of his planned invasion.\n As the Maggot Host’s ranks swell with Chaos-marked warriors from the Vasharan realms and beyond, Tamurkhan knows he…",
