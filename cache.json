You did well, very well.\"\n 'Really?'\n \"Yeah, that's what your sixth try? That was impressive, even more so for your age.

          "description": "It takes anywhere from twenty minutes to an hour for a person to calm down from an agitated emotional state. The Paleomancer had given both himself and Belial three days—and even then, he feared it wouldn’t be enough.\n This wasn’t really about diplomacy. Not entirely. Too much had been left unsaid—not just from their last confrontation, but since the day they first met: Bottled-up words, unspoken observations. The wizard could only hope his invitee would honor the request to come alone. Of course, there would be others watching from the shadows, but that was fine. The Paleomancer had nothing to say to them. His words were for the Praetor alone.\n The three-day wait had ended. Atollon stood silent, waiting. No roaring theropods, no bellowing sauropods, no flittering pterosaurs or breaching mosasaurs. The creatures had withdrawn to the island’s depths, leaving the coast eerily barren. Only the wind moved now, weaving through ancient vegetation.\n All that was left was to wait for his arrival.\n https://preview.redd.it/c88nijp5ahre1.jpg?width=557&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e4f823cfe7472f45bb4a6694db1eb37bcc4fbcd4\n    submitted by    /u/MeThyLord  \n [link]   [comments]",
