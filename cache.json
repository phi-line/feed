The day was perfectly calm until this strange person entered the tavern, covered in pale dust and in scandalous purple robes. This drunkard - I didn't know him personally but I've heard he be called 'Sbeve', something along those lines - he made the mistake of confronting this lunatic magician. He was all in his face, hurling insults, \"you look like a moldy blueberry!\" I remember was one of them. The mage didn't seem to notice him at first until... Brush This guy had just rested his arm on the man's shoulder, wiping away the dust on his skin. This was when the magician snapped, his face screwed like someone had just used power word: crunch.
