          "description": "Time of year to collect cuttings may vary depending on the location and type of grapevine. \n By using cuttings, growers can make sure that the plants they are growing will make the same quality of grapes. If they were to let the plants reproduce from seed then the resulting plant would be a mix of two different grapevines (we’re going to ignore perfect plants and self pollination for the sake of simplicity) meaning the resulting grapes could be drastically different. \n Not all plants can be grown from cuttings, if you’re planning to grow your own make sure to do some research! \n /uw no link today. It’s springtime in the northern hemisphere! Drink water, Go outside, and enjoy the sun and all the plants!\n For more like this check out r/druidposting \n    submitted by    /u/EmergencyLeading8137  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Vytsky had been acting rather odd since those trees came up from the ground. He had seemed to just… suddenly switch how he did things outside of his shop. He was out more, attending sermons praising Dominox, chatting with cult members, and even attending some executions.\n This was seriously unlike him. He existed before the universe itself, and yet he believed that Dominox was the one true god? It was obvious he wasn’t being mind-controlled, either. He kept his composure, maintained things at his shop like he always did. Nobody under mind-control could do that. And besides, he’d be pretty resistant against mind-control, too, right? So what the hell was he doing?\n if he was under any specific denomination, it was unclear, as he had been spotted in many places around the world. It was also unclear if he had obtained any new power from being under Dominox, but his glitches had been more common and intense than usual.\n Why? Why do this? What happened to him?\n /uw I’m exhausted and going to bed so you won’t hear from me until I wake up tomorrow morning. I will get notifications though, barring Reddit being stupid.

It's past should have remained a mystery, it should have been left in the mountain it was imprisoned in.\n One such being, an ordinary librarian, was unfortunate enough to learn some of the Gauntlets secrets. Far off in a distant realm, there was a town. One day the librarian found a book on one of the shelves, one that shouldn't be there. Curious, he opened the book.
