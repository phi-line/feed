          "description": "The way through treacherous weather in the woods would've been rough to walk knee deep snow, walking was difficult and yet there were dangers beneath the snow, slippery ice and rocks hidden bemeath the fluffy nd crunchy layers of snow.. The Northern lights glowed in the cloudless night sky amongst the moon as they reflected from frozen puddles of ice.. \n However as one reached a downhill, they would've been met by an onsen, in midst of nowhere, but seemed to have some activity as there were lights on as the wind had calmed down. As one entered the onsen, they were welcomed by warmth and smell of burning pine and sense of rest. But then a woman appeared from behind some curtains in a kimono with diamond patterns, her hair was white, as it flew behind her back over kimono, her eyes golden, a big and fluffy tail showed itself from beneath the kimono behind her, her fox ears twitched on top of her head. \n \"Ah, customers..\" \n a warm smile appeared over her face.\n \"There havent been many customers for centuries,baths are open, rooms open. Would you like to rest and relax here before you continue your journeys?\"\n The kitsune asked with welcoming and warm smile..\n    submitted by    /u/Purpleparentcake  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Bur Oaks are drought and fire resistant due to their long tap roots and thick bark! The trees can live for hundreds of years and only start producing acorns around 35 years old. The acorns are edible and have been used as a food source for as long as people have been in the americas. \n I didn’t have room for it, but I personally think the Bur Oak has some of the most beautiful leaves, flowers, and bark of any oak tree (you should google it it’s really pretty, you can see some pics on the Morton Arboretum site here) \n /uw are you in the Chicago area and want to check out some beautiful trees in person? Try the Morton Arboretum or consider donating today!

But despite the circumstances, it is quite a nice place to live, even with Dominox establishing a rip off Erdtree in the lake.
