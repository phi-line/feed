So, I decided to actually draw the little nerd, just for the heck of it. I just wanted to put an actual face to all of the necromancer chaos here, and the design just turned out too nice NOT to eventually post. So here's a WIP just to hold y'all over to the next lorepost here, lol. \n Sorry for how dang messy it is here; my sketches always kind of are, lol. But at least it makes sense to me. Kind of funny how this design started in the first place, though; there was a picture on Pinterest of some other kind of corset with ribs on it, and it was all just downhill from there. 😂 \n Also, I DID NOT know that I was able to actually draw vertebrae until this character design. 🤣 Literally the first time ever in my life that I've ever drawn them at all, really. But yeah, can you tell that drawing necromancers is kind of my artistic comfort zone? \n /UW END/\n    submitted by    /u/BankTypical  \n [link]   [comments]",
