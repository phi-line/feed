          "description": "Adding more layers of the usual barriers could boost the spell confinement additively proportinal to the strength of each barrier, but that gets expensive fast for fairly small yield gains.\n Instead, I've developed a class of resonant abjurations to superradiantly amplify a source of energy by recursively reflecting it into itself.\n I go about creating another one of these charges, except this time the disc and resultant bubble are tinged red.\n Each layer of this barrier multiplies the confined energy, so I create another red barrier disc and force my new bubble through to form a second layer. It's a bit larger, but still fits nicely in the palm of my hand. After just a few moments the surface is hot, signifying the energy is slowly leaking and the barriers are at capacity.\n \"Ok, this is double. Are you ready?\" I shout to my Simulacrum behind me, glancing over my shoulder. It replies \"I'm ready, I still have some mana left. I'll throw up a shield if something comes flying toward me.\"\n I nod and hurl the sphere with all my might, then duck inside the foxhole. There's a loud bang, definitely louder than before, but when I emerge the destruction still underwhelms. The scorch marks and area of flattened stalks extends only marginally farther than the first test.\n \"It was certainly brighter!\" My Simulacrum yells once the dust has settled.\n \"Even still, we're not getting much of a crater. This isn't doing it for me, I want more blast radius.\" I call back before getting to work on another test.\n    submitted by    /u/Odd-Concept-3693  \n [link]   [comments]",

At first it was the convoy raids, minor disruptions and his enemies' logistics Network more damaging to the economy when they were physically. Second was the seeding of AMCG cells throughout the globe, a decentralized network of anti-wizard militants who were allowed to pursue their own objectives. Commander sharp knew that would mainly mean bombing of magic academies and the assassination of some of the more minor wizards that moved throughout the realms. \n But with the successful acquisition of Sparrow's daughter it was time to move his plans forward, his true plans and the lies he tells.

It looks as a wizard should, with a wide brimmed pointed hat and robes bearing esoteric symbols threaded with golden filigree, both in matching ethereal blue. It waves to me as I approach and hands me a shovel.\n We get to work digging through the dry soil at the edge of the digsite. I hoist one shovelful after another from the slowly deepening hole as my Simulacrum swings a pickaxe overhead and into the earth.\n I wipe the sweat from my brow and notice my Simulacrum looks quite haggard. Realizing I must look just as weary from toil and neither of us are particularly suited for manual labor, I order a short break. We drop our tools and step out of the small knee deep pit to stretch.\n I conjure an Unseen Servant and send it to fetch some water from a hand pump back at the farmer's cottage. My Simulacrum reveals that, on previous orders to always think ahead, it has brought some supplies. It offers me a canteen and I drink the last of our water as my invisible helper slowly marches toward to the distant cottage, now a dot on the horizon.\n \"Back to work.\"\n    submitted by    /u/Odd-Concept-3693  \n [link]   [comments]",
