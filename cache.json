After having finished his allotted share of reports, forms, and bureaucracy, he had begun heading home and clearing his head of all the work throughout the day. Until he noticed someone. They… somewhat resembled the late Professor Friezen. Vanio blinked and he could quickly see it was just a stranger, no one he knew. Though disturbed, he continued walking on. Merely 5 steps later, he had to pause and check if he had heard her voice. Vanio quickened his pace. As he did so, he began to consult Amanoth, if they had anything to do with the tricks; Amanoth was quick to reply that they did not, though Vanio could really only take th…",

One sunny morning the mass read it: a quote! \n “What does it mean to dream?”\n The note pried.\n “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA”\n The mass replied.

So, he left a cheese wheel beneath it and through the pages he chewed.\n But he was still hungry.\n The mass awoke in a library and hunted for food. Across the shelves, chaos quickly ensued.\n In his search he ate through two books.\n The librarian warned him to stop but he was too late. And so, in his hunger, the magic…",
