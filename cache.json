No other voice in his head either.\n he was just, walking, on a cold, ashen, ground, for what felt like months. Though in actuality it had only been a few minutes, he didn’t know.\n looking closely, వ saw faint red dust in the air, neon in color. Core radiation. What had happened here? Not like he knew. \n So, he walked. For what felt like eternity\n At one point, he thought he saw a cliff in the distance, in this, endless, deserted, gravel landscape, but after blinking a few times, it was gone.\n Eventually, he found something. A small hatch in the ground, only barely covered up by the dust on the ground\n “Finally, something”\n flipping open the hatch, వ descends a stairway. It’s a dusty space, filled primarily with monitors. Powered by, a battery? Seems it can run for a while.\n powering it up, it booted up to a log-on screen of, Calarakis?\n “Oh, I remember now.” he said aloud, as he unlocked the computer. It led to a backup of various files from throughout the city. Latest dating to… doesn’t even know how long ago. It’s been just, walking, for so long that the day had been forgotten. Checking the system time led it to… today? No, that can’t be right.\n Click-click.\n it’s a shot of the inside of the Core system, it showcases readings on the left. Instability, graphs overloading, then-\n white\n the camera dies.\n “So. If the world isn’t dead, I’m still probably going to die here. I can’t cast any magic with this in the air. How did I even get here? How did I survive?”\n deciding to focus on more pragmatic efforts, he comes to the obvious conclusion.\n “Very little chance I’m going to be seen. Probably would’ve been found by now if I have.”\n he sulks into the chair, as it creaks with him leaning backward.\n /uw all of this is a dream, if your character can enter dreams, they can find him.
