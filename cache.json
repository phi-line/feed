Inside Orion's head Noiro was sitting, being very bored and having nothing to do as usual. Oriana was staring at him for a distance \n Noiro:... What do you want you freak?\n Oriana: oh nothing, bored as usual God he's so cute when he's grumpy\n Noiro: just stop staring at me\n After a bit Oriana was very bored and started looking around, she wandered off in a direction she had never gone before and a bit later she found a door labeled \"thoughts\".\n Oriana: hey dude wanna check this out?\n Noiro: ugh what is it? \n Noiro went up to the door as well and looked at it\n Noiro: you think we should go inside?\n Oriana: I mean, if you want to...\n Noiro: got nothing better to do anyways \n Noiro opens the door and they both see a long corridor with a bunch of other doors on the sides each with a different label. They walk up to one of them a it's labeled \"catgirls/catwomen\" \n Noiro: he's into this kind of stuff? Ew\n Oriana opens the door slightly and she sees Katherine along with some other catgirls before swiftly closing it\n Oriana: eh boring, ooh let's go to that one!\n She goes in front of a door labeled \"Pokemon\", opens it and goes inside along with Noiro. Inside they both see a big open field with a bunch of Pokemon. Oriana goes up to a Bulbasaur and starts petting it while Noiro pokes a Psyduck which hugs him.\n Oriana brings Bulbasaur to Noiro and before he gets a chance to speak she hugs him and the two pokemon. After a big she lets go and the pokemon seem happy while Noiro seems shaken.\n Noiro: what was that?!\n Oriana: what, a hug? It's a gesture of affection you dummy \n Noiro: hmph it's not like I liked it anyways why did that feel so warm and kinda nice?\n    submitted by    /u/Orion_gamer1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A newly made lemure crawled out of a pit in the Nine Hells. This would not normally be a notable occurrence but in this case the soul of being that it consisted of caught some attention once a devil of higher rank stumbled across it. A phone call was made to one of Johnbots of the CEO of Hell. After a long conversation and a verification of the identity of the soul a deal was reached.\n A ritual was performed, the lemure was given a modest amount of power and what emerged was a lemure no longer but a Rakshasa of modest power. With a growl it flexed its new form and examined the documents provided by the imp. A copy of the contract and an ID.\n Kalim Tigerius Urthus, newly commisioned jeweler and merchant of the Nine Hells. A most appropriate profession for him. He even knew where there was a lovely stash of jewels was located to get him started. Kalim took a hard step, his leg buckled a Dan he frowned. Right. He couldn’t do that anymore. New stage of existence, new powers. That would take some getting used to.\n Kalim took a moment to close his eyes and focus. Then with a pop he plane shifted to his target destination. A massive cavern filled with beautiful and artistically grown gems of all colors and varieties. Kalim knelt down before one and lifted the perfectly grown sapphire to admire it. Perhaps one day the ability to grow such beauty would be his once more. For now he would have to settle with admiring and sadly, selling them.\n Kalim gathered a number more of them, retrieved a few trinkets and weapons, then shifted to another location. There was work to do and deal to keep. Even in life, Kalim had been a soul of his word, he wasn’t going to break that now. It would be a difficult task but he would have to figure it out.\n /uw With the death of Atriox, a new face appears. \n    submitted by    /u/AtrioxCalamity  \n [link]   [comments]",
