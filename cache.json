          "description": "Capitol City of Kabaheim. Mercenary Guild Territory\n Cerene strode down the hallways of the capitol building, her cloak billowing behind her. Despite the last time she was here being almost a year ago, her credentials still worked, and none of the checkpoints gave her trouble as she made her way to Counselor Five’s office. \n She was nervous, her mechanical arm twitching every couple of seconds. It did that sometimes when her heart rate was above normal. But she needed to do this. Her recent encounter with Lianna had convinced her she needed to do this. She had to face her failure. \n Rounding a corner, she strode down the length of a long hallway to a set of large double doors. The doors to Five’s office. Cerene knew there were ECHOs hiding in the shadows nearby, but they should recognize h…",

          "description": "The ballroom was burning. \n Not in the traditional sense—no flames licked the velvet curtains, and no smoke choked the air—but something was undeniably wrong. The chandeliers swayed to music that wasn’t playing, shadows stretched and recoiled like dancers caught mid-step, and the guests… well, the guests had stopped moving entirely. \n A single bony foot tapped against the marble floor, an offbeat rhythm against the silence. NecroDancer stood at the center of it all, arms outstretched, his purple robe swirling with a dramatic flair that no natural wind had caused. His silver crown tilted at an impossible angle, and the skeletal grin beneath it never wavered. \n “Ladies and gentlemen, and everything in between!” he announced, his voice echoing with a theatrical boom. “What a dismal party this…",

As a vengeful spirit, Tsuru did not need sleep, but it’s just one of those things she does out of preference. She rolled to her side and curled up on the futon, preparing herself for ‘slumber’. Her eyes shut and her entire world turned dark.\n The soft crunching sound of footsteps filled her ears. Trees flanked the onmyouji as she walked up the mountain road. She looked up and found that the stars shimmered in the moonlit sky. Despite the apparent calmness, none of the ambient sounds of the night could be heard. It was unnaturally quiet.\n Tsuru continued walking on the dirt path for what she felt was hours. She was quite familiar with this road, the same road she used when she was alive.

Kardonk had been expanding trade routes for Ithacar’s exports, and this boat was an attempt at determining which of many alternatives were most efficient.\n Sloop at half sail, 6 other mechanical spiders scurry about the deck, working on minimizing crosswind. While the ship gets moving, steam emanates upward from the sea floor, most of it ending up underneath the boat, leaving some small whiffs on the edges, though no mind is paid to this as the inorganic members of this vessel observe the horizon in order to chart headwinds and tides.\n After a few hours, when the boat has long since gotten out of any wards, and is now in the sea, 6 of the spiders are suddenly hit by lightning.
