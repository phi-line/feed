Via YouTube.\nPerhaps it was the end of millennium — and its attendant Y2K doomerism — mixed with the increasing sophistication of computer graphics. Whatever it was, 1999 proved to be a milestone year for the concept of virtual worlds.\nPhilip Rosedale was working for RealNetworks as its Chief Technology Officer in 1999 when he and some of his colleagues went to see a new movie called The Matrix. The movie was unlike anything that had come before, with its techno-apocalyptic virtual world plot that you needed at least two viewings to decipher, its computer green filter and cyberpunk costumes, and the astonishing “bullet time” special ef…",

It went on to explain that Bowie and his guitarist Reeves Gabrels had “worked closely with the game's developers, Paris-based Quantic Dream, to create original music for the game, including eight new songs.”\nThe concept of this 3D game involved a futuristic city called Omikron, demons that collect souls, and (like Bowie’s 1995 Outside album concept) a spate of serial killings.

          "description": "One of the innovations of podcasting is its concept of \"seasons,\" which originally comes from the world of television. The idea is that you have a time-bounded series of podcast episodes — sometimes with a set theme, but other times the season boundary is simply a given time period.\nI first became aware of 'seasons' in podcasts with Serial in 2014, which used the term to indicate a series of episodes on a certain topic. Each season (there have just been 4) starts an entirely new storyline. But another podcast I enjoy, by the writer Bret Easton Ellis, has \"seasons\" that are demarcated by calendar years. He's currently in season 9, which began on January 7, 2025 (season 8 ended December 31, 2024).\nWhat I'm doing with Cybercultural seasons is a mix of those two approaches. I have different to…",

During that year, there were hints that Google was emerging — even before it officially incorporated in September, it was gaining credence among industry insiders as a search technology to watch. But for all of 1998, the leading names in search were either portals (Yahoo, Netscape, Excite) or search engines trying to turn themselves into portals (AltaVista, Infoseek, Lycos).\nWith the portals, often the search function was either partly or fully outsourced. So when assessing how popular a particular search engine was, you first needed to work out how it was integrated into the leading portals or directories of the day.\nTake AltaVista, for example.

On May 3, 1997, Billboard ran a story about MTV’s latest redesign. “The newly revamped World Wide Web site for MTV contains a heavy amount of original music content and a unique Web browser design,” noted the article.

He’d started out as an aspiring fiction author, briefly worked as a journalist, tried his hand as a touring musician, and then spent ten years in the advertising business. “Writing billboards and coming up with quick visuals was good training for the web because you have to communicate something instantly,” he later said in an interview.\nIt was the rise of multimedia that attracted creatives like Zeldman, who made hi…",

I find it hard to write recipes for such salads, though, perhaps because there are often so many ingredient variations and little precedence, but today’s one made the cut. If you make it, please let me know if it made you feel “perky” in any way.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "The sweetness of roast vegetables and raisins contrasts with balsamic, pine nuts and capers in a vibrant dish that you’ll want to eat on repeat\nBeing in the business of recipe writing means I am always seeking the new, always moving on and rarely resting on a single dish. Until summer starts knocking, that is. The sun makes me want to slow down, and I find myself wanting a variation of vegetables agrodolce on repeat. Agrodolce is Italian for sour (agro) and sweet (dolce), which in my kitchen translates to a pile of meltingly soft vegetables, all slick with olive oil, sweet with onions, and cut with vinegar and capers. Often, this takes the form of my husband Hugh’s oven-baked caponata, but I also love the comfort of squash and the liquorice sweetness of the cooked fennel here.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "Savoury, nutty, salty-sweet – and delicious with rice\nHere are two things about aubergines that you may not know: first, they are giant berries (!) and, second, they’re roughly 92% water. The latter is important, because to get this mighty berry to reach its delicious potential, we need to dehydrate it (that is, remove as much water as possible and then hit it with lots of flavour). You could fry it, but, when the weather is lovely, I prefer hands-free cooking, which means roasting it. In this recipe, after roasting, I’ve used one of my favourite braising liquids – a mix of soy sauce, sake and sesame – to bring the aubergine back to life.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "These vegan burgers are child’s play and fun to make, too\nThis is exactly my kind of recipe. It’s easy, flavourful and, as a bonus, it’s crispy, too. In fact, it’s so simple, you could make the mixture with your eyes closed or, better still, give it to a six-year-old to do (they could also make it with their eyes closed). The key is the black beans, because they crisp up perfectly, and the condiments, which supercharge the flavour. There is one small catch, though: the onions need caramelising until they’re jammy, and ready to top the patty. You don’t have to do this, but I’m here to tell you that it is worthwhile (especially if there’s a six-year-old already making the burgers).\n Continue reading...",
