He asked—patiently, persistently—for months, chasing Council members, leaving notices, summoning meetings. Always the same excuses. Always the same avoidance.

He much preferred to rather listen to them from a shadowy spot.\n There was no time to wait, however. Most of R&A knew he went out to challenge Hirk to make him retake his position, and both of them returned a few days ago.\n Rumors already started spreading, so he had to clear up everything as soon as possible.\n “As probably all of you know, I went out last week when R&A caught whispers of a man eerily similar to Hirk wandering around the countryside.”\n “I intended for him to fight me, to resolve the question of R&A leadership.”\n “And so, we did. We had an official duel for the seat, right in the middle of a ghost town.”\n He glanced across the audience, Relief Force, and many of the “Notable Mages” too. The crowd’s anticipation was almost tangible in the air. Time to deliver the news.\n “We didn’t finish the duel. Instead, Hirk proposed an idea for a new leadership structure.”\n “In the future, R&A would have two leaders: one elected by the people, and one elected by an internal vote. Two heads, overseeing both each other and the organization.”\n “This would not only mean a more stable structure but also lessen the workload of the leader. We’re still sorting out who’d get which tasks.”\n The hall was filled by a swirl of murmurs. Some fearful, some excited. Ulrick had a good guess what most of those were about. Good thing he was just about to address that.\n The true grand news of the day.\n “I know, some of you must be wondering, how a Council wing would have two seats. Would the Council even allow that?”\n “And for that, we have a simple solution. One we’ve been planning for so long.”\n Ulrick put the speech to a short halt, to raise the tension even further. Before dropping the most important declaration of all.\n “We’re going independent from the Council.”\n    submitted by    /u/UlrickTheHexblade  \n [link]   [comments]",

Ten Suns would trade his Titan’s blood for Leviathan tears. Unfortunately, Kalim didn’t have those but another person had them. Unfortunately that person wanted a bicorn horn. To get the bicorn horn though Kalim would need rainbow pearls. Unfortunately the person with the rainbow pearls wanted the power of Gaia…\n Kalim was quite irritated by the busywork of a CHAINED FETCH QUEST. Seriously he was a fiend from the Nine Hells and not even he was that sadistic. He would track down whatever soul invented the idea of the chained fetch quest and make sure that soul ceased to exist. They were probably already in the Nine Hells for their sadism anyways.\n Kalim stalked along and then paused. Wait a minute… KALIM KNEW A TITAN ALREADY! With tears of joy the Rakshasa flew off to find Atlas and asking for a drop of blood, leaving the Chained Fetch Quest from beyond Hell behind. An hour later he had the blood, which he traded for with Atlas the Titan in exchange for the last bottle of 774 Lemarcia red wine. Expensive? Yes, but so worth it to skip the stupid, stupid, stupid CHAINED FETCH QUEST. Now he just had to find the extixnct race of gem folk that was the target of his Rod of Resurrection.\n Oh and find a specific soul to rend apart. \n    submitted by    /u/AtrioxCalamity  \n [link]   [comments]",
