          "description": "I've grown quite keen to dragons through my quite extensive research and studies, but since some lower denomination of time, I've realized that a question what a dragon is, is still left unanswered, which for a person like me is more than frustrating.\n By that, I mean are dragons more like fish, or like crabs. Since there is not really a close connection to many creatures we call dragons, like wyverns, jabberwocks, hydras, giant snails, snake like wyrms or even true dragons, either the western or eastern variety, which are more closely related. All of those creatures are called dragons, and it's mostly due to they're similar features, or so many people think, since what are those similar features actually. \n Lizard like appearance is common, but there are many dragons with slug like appear…",

          "description": "The Central Convergence, where all four sources—Arcane, Primal, Occult, and Divine—unite, is the most potent and mysterious manifestation of magic. It represents the ultimate blend of internal mastery, external natural forces, mortal ingenuity, and divine will. At its essence lies magic in its purest form, transcending all boundaries and limitations. This is the realm of Universalism, the rare and awe-inspiring practice that channels the totality of existence into raw power. Let’s delve into its intricacies.\n The Nature of the Convergence At the Central Convergence, the distinct boundaries between the sources dissolve.

If they were to let the plants reproduce from seed then the resulting plant would be a mix of two different grapevines (we’re going to ignore perfect plants and self pollination for the sake of simplicity) meaning the resulting grapes could be drastically different. \n Not all plants can be grown from cuttings, if you’re planning to grow your own make sure to do some research! \n /uw no link today.

He was out more, attending sermons praising Dominox, chatting with cult members, and even attending some executions.\n This was seriously unlike him. He existed before the universe itself, and yet he believed that Dominox was the one true god? It was obvious he wasn’t being mind-controlled, either. He kept his composure, maintained things at his shop like he always did. Nobody under mind-control could do that. And besides, he’d be pretty resistant against mind-control, too, right? So what the hell was he doing?\n if he was under any specific denomination, it was unclear, as he had been spotted in many places around the world. It was also unclear if he had obtained any new power from being under Dominox, but his glitches had been more common and intense than usual.\n Why? Why do this? What happened to him?\n /uw I’m exhausted and going to bed so you won’t hear from me until I wake up tomorrow morning. I will get notifications though, barring Reddit being stupid.
