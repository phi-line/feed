It all got me wondering, what is position of kitsunes in this realm and how are they treated, are they treated fairly, and such.\n As a kitsune, I grew interested to know how my beings are treated amongst wizards, witches, sorcerers, necromancers.\n and importantly, what are your thoughts on kitsunes, how do you see them?\n Sincerely, Kohaku.\n    submitted by    /u/Purpleparentcake  \n [link]   [comments]",

During the day Arach’s mind was bombarded from her mental connection to her kin. But with most of her kin asleep Arach’s senses were cleared. The constant deluge of information ceased. The knowledge of every spider’s whereabouts and actions, their thoughts and sensations, was cut off by a dreamless slumber she forced upon them. Arach always enjoyed the time of day, and her own lack of need to sleep allowed her to enjoy it to the fullest. She sat upright in her bed, skimming over some biomancy research for the next day. The soft music playing from her orb was interrupted as she burst into a coughing fit. The sound of her hacking echoed off the glass walls until it becam…",
