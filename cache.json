          "description": "Think of it, the only bound on your bagic being the spells you know and the time in the day you have to cast them. What would you spend your day doing? \n I have crossed that line long ago where mana intake is far more than my output could be if I was casting 24/7 so I want a fresh take from wizards that are still working out an answer.
