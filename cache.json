This includes, but is certainly not limited to: * Unforeseen Rampages: Should your golem develop an unexpected fondness for smashing local produce stands or engaging in impromptu demolition derbies, Golem Guardians, Inc. accepts precisely zero culpability. * Sentience Surprises: If your golem suddenly develops a penchant for philosophical debates or existential angst, please consult your local arcane therapist, not us. * Accidental Transmutation: Should your golem accidentally turn your prize-winning toad into a teacup (or vice versa), we suggest a strongly worded letter to the golem, as we are not liable. * Misinterpreted Commands: If your golem interprets \"fetch\" as \"rearrange the city skyline,\" you'll find our customer service line remarkably busy. * Emotional Outbursts: Golems, despite their impenetrable exteriors, can be sensitive. If yours decides to express its feelings by burying your rival wizard in a pile of pebbles, that's between you and your local constable.\n In essence, you are the golem's master, and thus, its master's responsibility. Golem Guardians, Inc. provides the golem; you provide the common sense (hopefully).
