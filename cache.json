He studied ancient books and scrolls... At the local library. \n Of course that didn't get him far but he learnt the spell summon stone elemental. Although because of his age it wasn't really powerful he saw potential in it. He spent a whole week casting it every evening and had managed to create an army of 10.000.000.\n It was a small but needed step to survive Atriox's inevitable attack. \n    submitted by    /u/Orion_gamer1  \n [link]   [comments]",
