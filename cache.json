After a brutal and costly confrontation between the armies of Earth's Embrace and the Maggot Host along the nations' southern border, Atriox the Calamity was slain and his forces were dislodged from the realm. Despite grievous losses, the invaders immediately set their sights upon the rest of the realm. A few days later, Rando and Knowhere fell to Tamurkhan. Already weakened by war with Atriox and each other, their remaining armies fought bravely before succumbing to the Vasharan champions of Nurgle. In the end, the Maggot Host lost two-thirds of its forces, but gained a major strategic foothold within striking distance of the wider magical realms.
