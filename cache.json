          "description": "It was terrifying... I was just at the tavern, hanging about, drinking ale, as one does. The day was perfectly calm until this strange person entered the tavern, covered in pale dust and in scandalous purple robes. This drunkard - I didn't know him personally but I've heard he be called 'Sbeve', something along those lines - he made the mistake of confronting this lunatic magician. He was all in his face, hurling insults, \"you look like a moldy blueberry!\" I remember was one of them. The mage didn't seem to notice him at first until... Brush This guy had just rested his arm on the man's shoulder, wiping away the dust on his skin. This was when the magician snapped, his face screwed like someone had just used power word: crunch. It didn't take long until there was an orange flash, and before me was no longer the drunkard but now a round, crispy, inch long chicken nugget.\n    submitted by    /u/Salty_Egg_1063  \n [link]   [comments]",

Regardless of what they chose, everyone and everything bent the knee in time. One individual was more difficult to wrangle than most. Deep in the mountainous north regions of Xyreen, freedom was extremely abundant.\n The inhabitants did what they wanted to do when they wanted to do it. The abilities of the people varied, but one thing remained constant. In order to survive, you needed to fly. This didn't mean feathers but those without left one day and didn't come back.

Among the celestials they are the ones that posses the best planshifting abilities. Abilities that are at the very heart of their reproductive cycle\n They reproduce in the celestial realms but the only place they lay their eggs in is the deep layers of the abyss where the demon grow so big and strong that the most powerfull of them claim the title of demi god\n But once they are born the larvae have no predators\n They are born as tall and as long as a train with 4 wagons \n Their fluff make them imunue to heat up to 6000000 K and down to 0 K \n It is also a perfect electricity , humidity and magical isolant \n The skin under it is 30 cm thick and extremely solid , the muscle fibers are stronger than spider silk fibers and are so thick that even when dead the larvae require more than 50 t of pressure to lift one of its leg a few millimetres . Dead they stand like statue for the rest of eternity\n In the abyss , killing a seraphim larvae is considered an exploit worthy of aquiring the status of demi god\n    submitted by    /u/IncomeApprehensive17  \n [link]   [comments]",
