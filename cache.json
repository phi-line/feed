          "description": "After completing my morokov chain planar enchantment on my tower to allow for working multiple plans at once, my gargoyle sentries started to malfunction.\n Of the eight I had stationed on my tower five have disappeared, and the other three are inoperable. I knew that they wouldn't last long (they were a bulk purchase from BJ max) but I thought they would have some durability to acausal fluctuations.\n If anyone can help me find those five gargoyles I can re-enchant them to Improve their performance. I will offer items from my curio collection to any helping hands. Each gargoyle has my insignia etched into their forehead. A cube slowly rotating on a 2D plane. If the image isn't moving it isn't my gargoyle.\n A reminder that they could be in any dimension now, so keep your orbs scrying.\n    submitted by    /u/Hearth_Palms_Farce  \n [link]   [comments]",
