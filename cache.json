Thomas’s tunic was signed from Kanthar’s dragon fire. Jay had a tiny bit of fire in his hair. Thomas pinches the fire out and collapses onto the ground from the exhaustion.\n “Ugh…”\n “A-are you ok?”\n Jay looks over the old man on the ground, worry in his eyes.\n “Yes I’m fine. Only a few bruises. This is a fine mess we’re in.” Thomas sits up. “I dont think going back to the farm is a safe idea anymore…Shadeholme wants your head on a stick, and worst of all I don’t have the foggiest idea of where we are right now.”\n As he says that, Jay realizes that he doesn’t recognize where he is.

But Kavrala's oil corruption arc has ended!\n I've been waiting to share this art for around two months now! There's gonna be plenty more to come! And you KNOW I'll be drawing more dragons! The Sanctuary is coming back and it'll be more diverse than ever!\n All in all, this is just a thank you to everyone who participated in my story arc. Being able to interact with you all as our characters; It makes everything worth it, especially when I agonize over how a sentence sounds or how a drawing looks, lol.\n So to everyone, whether we've spoken to each other or not, thank you.\n It's kinda crazy to think that I've been on the sub for three years now. I look back at my first ever post on here and can't even believe that Kavrala used to not exist, and that she almost had four arms at one point!\n I love this community.\n Ah, regardless, Kav is no longer an oily abomination! She's been cleansed and has some slight amnesia!! I plan on doing posts for her recovery and also to cleanse the land that got destroyed during the arc as well!\n Ah, and enjoy some extra art too, why not?\n    submitted by    /u/Traxxya  \n [link]   [comments]",
