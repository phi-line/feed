          "description": "Three years ago my master sent me off on my quest to study the supernatural forces in the magical forest. It had been going well for about a year, but then some clueless losers showed up about two years ago and decided to make a camp by my newly constructed tower. At first I kept to myself and thought this was going to be temporary campsite, but nope they cut down part of the magical forest I’m supposed to be studying to build some stupid cottages. Now the wood nymphs and forest spirits will not talk to me anymore because they think it’s my fault for bringing these peasants to the forest. \n This delayed my studies and normally would not be a problem, but you see they started this group called a Cottage Owner Association (COA). This stupid association has been a pain my butt! This group insists that my tower is an eyesore! They also say it’s dangerous, but it’s not my fault little Timmy tried climbing the tower and died when he fell off. They told me to bring my tower “up to code” and remove the vines and moss growing all over it. They were also telling me that all changes to my tower must be approved by the COA. Ugh… just talking about it makes me want to disable the magical barrier and let the monsters of the forest devour all the peasants.\n I feel like there are other options that I am not considering. Are there any other wizards here that have dealt with associations like this? Any suggestions will be appreciated. \n    submitted by    /u/PointyDoor135  \n [link]   [comments]",
