This feeling of tiredness was highly unusual, but she did not think much of it.\n A pile of papers sat on her desk. All of them contained reports of the activities she had done within the previous months.

He wears a large cloak, it did not hide who he was, simply enchanted to let folks know he’d rather they forget he was there.\n “Mr Petrikov, it is good seeing you my friend, now I must remind you I was never here.”\n ‘Of course not Hirk, you are too busy elsewhere being useless ya old drunk.’\n “I haven’t drank in a while, been clean for a few months.

Freedom came at a price, but was he doing any better outside of a jail cell? He could argue that he posed a greater danger to the world than ever before, but things were in motion that could not be changed. The Fates will act as they please.\n The doors were opened and Goatdigger saw a long line of elves on either side of the corridor. They knew who he was. Worse than elephants and dwarves with their grudges. He’d hoped the years would have dimmed their ire, but Gaia seemed to have spent the intervening time sharpening their animosity.\n Walking between the lines of elves, all manner of abuse rained down on Goatdigger.
