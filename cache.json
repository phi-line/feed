But their Commander had a different purpose for them to have them be sacrificed to feed their suffering to their dreadlord and that they did so splendidly. \n But as threatening as it was the dreadlord could not hope to stand against the cosmic Arc of the universe, the flow of concordance and order that guides the universe to peace.
