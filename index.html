 The instant Sabre had broken a chain the armor teleported away, the moment the first curse had waited generations for had finally come to pass. Sabre realized the grave mistake he made. Everyone was gone, or at least most of them. The exceptions were Light, who the armor hadn’t accounted for, due to his energy being unique, a Green he knew, who resided outside of where the kingdoms were, and happened to have been missed, and Hypno, who was somehow immune to being unwillingly placed in it
 With the former two Sabre ventured to the red kingdom, and found the Assistant, an artificial being, made by the Red Professor, not organic, so was skipped by the armor. Following this, they discovered the Core, the most powerful energy source in the world. The Assistant later located where the ar…</span>

 For 6 months Sabre, or more accurately, his Shadow, like Void was to Seer, was Void’s most powerful agent, able to decimate entire cities in days. All the survivors fled to the final kingdom, the rainbow kingdom. Sabre was thankfully able to escape the corruption, and quickly turned on Void, using the darkness to now destroy the crystal-wielding original hero. Seer’s soul, or now more so void’s, began to plummet to the world below, looking to become a Demon, but through some twist of fate, Void made a deal with the First Curse somehow. He would keep his sapience, and be a leader of the demons. The crystals, now weakened, merged into a single rainbow crystal upon void’s death. The darkness still remained, though without a leader, it was nearly harmless, and receded.

 Part 3
 A strange being appeared one day, going solely by the name of “Sabre”, perhaps this was a title, as if he were a weapon of justice for the people of the realm.
 he was an odd being, lacking any abilities that Origin’s creations had. He could not teleport like the indigos or create like the oranges. He lacked the great knowledge of the reds, or the speed of the yellows. He could not heal like the greens, wasn’t immortal like the blues, and he couldn’t amplify like the violets.
 But with his existence, the Darkness stirred. His appearance somehow prompted Void to start gaining strength. His very existence was a punched hole in the darkness, which allowed Void to return to a true physical form, a…</span>

                              <span>++OFFICIAL COUNCIL DOCUMENT - TOP SECRET - DO NOT DISSEMINATE++
 Name: Orion Jordan 
 Titles/Aliases: Ori 
 Age: 1 (almost 2)
 Species: Firbolg 
 Gender: Male
 Nationally: Unknown (possibly Greek)
 Magical Specialism: None
 Known Weaknesses: Getting hit by most nonmagical attacks, Peach allergy 
 Caster Grade: Adept
 Council Loyalty Classification: Red
 Threat Level: Delta
 Overview: The unusual amount of IQ he was born with is truly fascinating. Although he always claims to be very powerful and should be respected people always treat him as they would treat a normal baby with pats hugs ect. He normally isn&#x27;t much of a threat as he is what you would call &quot;lawful good&quot; although if pissed off he can deal some mediocre damage. He seriously hates crime and wants to take law into his own hands when possible to &quot;deliver justice&quot;. It should be noted that most of the times he wants to do that he has no way of finding the &quot;target&quot; and isn&#x27;t strong enough to beat them anyways. It is noteworthy that two other versions of himself Noiro and Oriana live inside his brain, Noiro is Orion&#x27;s evil version, he is &quot;chaotic evil&quot;. Oriana on the other hand is more erotically active and a menace to those around her, she is neutral.
 Contingencies: It should be noted that if Orion was to be faced with some kind of serious criminal his justice sence would overcome him and he would create incredibly powerful &quot;justice blasts&quot;. In addition if he were to somehow grow up momentarily (for example with an aging potion) he would get notably more powerful.
