                              <span>I apologize but I need this right now, I need this place. Unfortunately this is exactly as it sounds. My patron goddess has decided to no longer supply me, I am without my powers and I must learn to use the weave anew. It&#x27;s everything I got not to say fuck it and become a Lich. I keep telling myself undeath is forever but it doesn&#x27;t hold the same gravitas as it did when she shined her love on me. 5 years of magic, minions and enchantment lost. I am struggling hard my fellow casters, please say an incantation for me.

 YOU ARE ALL LYING FRAUDS WITHOUT AN OUNCE OF MAGIC!
 Guess that means I get to eat you all much more easily than I anticipated. Now let me just grab the salt real quick and we will get started with dinner.

                              <span>I’m visiting my cousin from a distant land! His name is Aku, the deliverer of darkness, the shogun of sorrow, all that good stuff. Fun guy to hang around, haven’t seen him in a while! 
 Feel free to say hi! I’ve brought my orb with me, but he says he can see everything anyway so…yeah! 
 Uw/ I’ve been rewatching Samurai Jack and have decided that Aku is a Tiny cousin. I will not take criticism on this. 
 All art is by me! I can (kind of) draw again, yay!

 Calarakis. The City of Good. Hardly anyone dared to commit a crime there, and those who did dare would face heavy punishment. A few weeks ago, Vytsky had decided to move there, hoping that he would be attacked less frequently. This had been quite true, and he was enjoying it. He was sleeping better at night...

 ...but ultimately, that was the only thing that&#x27;s improved for him so far. He was far from cured.

 Business was booming, and he was enjoying the company of his customers.. mostly, anyway. Some were rude, but hey, it happens; always has, always will. But lately, all this extra work had him overwhelmed. He decided to close up s…</span>

 “Our realm should reflect us,” he had argued. 
 They had agreed, and so the Dragon Well had been created, a massive font of power designed to replace the natural leylines that had been severed during Haven’s shift into a more defensible Demiplane. 
 The intent behind this was twofold: 
 Firstly, many dragons, including himself, subsisted on the ambient mana produced by leylines and, to a lesser extent, inefficiently cast spells. When such mana was plentiful this ability could even completely remove the need to obtain sustenance from physical sources. Where this particular ability came from was hotly debated, but few could deny its obvious benefits.

 “What was that!” Vince shouted out staring off into the distance of the sea. There was not one sound after that hit. I looked around where I had seen the swirls in the first place. I felt something, a spite, a strong hate and anger. 
  
 “Pilot?” Liam looked at me with slight fear, I felt like he knew what I felt and knew what it was, his ears pinned down and his tail twitching right under his legs, he was like a scared dog.

 That, in and of itself, was not a problem. He had been dead before, for much the same reasons. Picking a fight beyond his capacity, it seemed, was in danger of becoming a habit. 
 A habit he could have immediately made plans to correct if not for one simple problem: He was not where he was supposed to be. The towering gothic edifices of the Shadowfell were nowhere to be seen. 
 He stood, instead, in a long hallway carved from a black stone he could not identify. Between the arches lay murals. 
 No, not murals, he realized as he stared at the sight before him. Glass. Cracked and distorted. He raised a talon and touched the pane, the sight behind it somehow familiar. The glass shattered into fragments, revealing an image so lifelike he could swear that a single step would…</span>

I find how each school of magic tends to answer this with a new perspective each generation of wizards that are born to take on the line of teaching.
