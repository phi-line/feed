                              <span>I covered my mouth with my hands, simply watching the two interact with anxiety. Was Liam really a pirate, with Vince.
  
 “Go check out on the east, I&#x27;ll check on the west.” Liam says with a slight worried look, when Vince leaves to the east Liam comes my way.
  
 I panicked, I got out of the bushes with my ears lowered, afraid. He gave me a look, a look of guilt, it made me think maybe he was still my friend.
  
 “Pilot…” he started, unable to finish without feeling awful. His ears lowered too. “I put the necklace on Cassidy&#x27;s neck so you can come… and find out… because… I can’t keep it hidden anymore, I want you to be like me, join our crew.” He said with a gleam in his eyes, he grabbed my hands and held them to his chest at his heart. 
  
 I looked into his eyes, my heart was pounding …</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s gone! I don&#x27;t know where it went! It was put safely away in my dresser next to my alchemy/pool table and now one of my socks is gone!
 It&#x27;s red, bright red. With pink trim. The red threads are faux phoenix feather fibers and the pinks ones are wool.
 I would understand stealing the pair. They&#x27;re nice socks after all. But one? Just one?!
 My gargoyle sentries said that no one entered my tower over the night, but I was sertain that both socks were folded nearly in the dresser and now one&#x27;s missing.
 I couldn&#x27;t have misplaced it. My tower is enchanted so that I may know where everything is at all times. Perhaps I should update the enchanted so that I may replay events that occur within the tower as well.
 Please help me find my sock!

It all got me wondering, what is position of kitsunes in this realm and how are they treated, are they treated fairly, and such.
 As a kitsune, I grew interested to know how my beings are treated amongst wizards, witches, sorcerers, necromancers.
 and importantly, what are your thoughts on kitsunes, how do you see them?
 Sincerely, Kohaku.

During the day Arach’s mind was bombarded from her mental connection to her kin. But with most of her kin asleep Arach’s senses were cleared. The constant deluge of information ceased. The knowledge of every spider’s whereabouts and actions, their thoughts and sensations, was cut off by a dreamless slumber she forced upon them. Arach always enjoyed the time of day, and her own lack of need to sleep allowed her to enjoy it to the fullest. She sat upright in her bed, skimming over some biomancy research for the next day. The soft music playing from her orb was interrupted as she burst into a coughing fit. The sound of her hacking echoed off the glass walls until it becam…</span>

                              <span>Call forth the necrodancer from his sleep to grace us with the dance of death ince more!
 The councel will be forced to dance as puppets at his hand and the world will rejoice in mortal pain being a thing of the past! 
 Be slaves no more to anything, but the rhythm!
