                              <span>++OFFICIAL COUNCIL DOCUMENT - TOP SECRET - DO NOT DISSEMINATE++
 Name: Orion Jordan 
 Titles/Aliases: Ori 
 Age: 1 (almost 2)
 Species: Firbolg 
 Gender: Male
 Nationally: Unknown (possibly Greek)
 Magical Specialism: None
 Known Weaknesses: Getting hit by most nonmagical attacks, Peach allergy 
 Caster Grade: Adept
 Council Loyalty Classification: Red
 Threat Level: Delta
 Overview: The unusual amount of IQ he was born with is truly fascinating. Although he always claims to be very powerful and should be respected people always treat him as they would treat a normal baby with pats hugs ect. He normally isn&#x27;t much of a threat as he is what you would call &quot;lawful good&quot; although if pissed off he can deal some mediocre damage. He seriously hates crime and wants to take law into his own hands when possible to &quot;deliver justice&quot;. It should be noted that most of the times he wants to do that he has no way of finding the &quot;target&quot; and isn&#x27;t strong enough to beat them anyways. It is noteworthy that two other versions of himself Noiro and Oriana live inside his brain, Noiro is Orion&#x27;s evil version, he is &quot;chaotic evil&quot;. Oriana on the other hand is more erotically active and a menace to those around her, she is neutral.
 Contingencies: It should be noted that if Orion was to be faced with some kind of serious criminal his justice sence would overcome him and he would create incredibly powerful &quot;justice blasts&quot;. In addition if he were to somehow grow up momentarily (for example with an aging potion) he would get notably more powerful.

 Watching the ocean from the beach, dense forest behind me rustles in the wind as the sun sets, I look out upon the gently lapping waves, cold or warm, I do not know, I haven&#x27;t known for a long time as the water rushes to brush against my feet before gently returning
 Darkness overtakes light as I sit, and as the sun fully retreats behind the horizon I rise, to go to what I&#x27;m calling home for now
 Along the small game trail to an even smaller cottage, if not kept so neat with a full tended garden it would look ramshackle and abandoned, as it was when I found it
 I&#x27;ve been living here for the better part of ten years now, as a healer, what I lack in healing spells I make up for with potions and various salves, I&#x27;ve a reputation as a kind soul, denying payment to those wh…</span>

                              <span>General Silverado the 21st, leader of the blue helmet peacekeeping organization, had received Intel that prompted her to seek out a second opinion. 
 Based on what the scouts she sent her, and the law of conservation of matter and energy, there were crimes against sapience and free will afoot. 
 With only three aircraft carriers, two destroyers, two amphibious tanks, and roughly ten thousand souls under her command, she realized she would need assistance with thwarting this cult.
 The megacities where the cults are based were huge. Possible that there were millions there. 
 Now if there&#x27;s anything she learned from watching her teacher commiting various war crimes himself, it&#x27;s that the vermensk empire takes free will very seriously.

                              <span>In the mountains of Haven, a ritual was under way as it had been for the last three days. Its inhabitants leapt and chanted and beat upon the ceremonial drums as the fires climbed higher and higher. Great pillars of dark power stabbed into the skies, a single beating heart in the center of the circle. 
 The participants rotated out in shifts, one group resting fitfully while another ate and drank and relieved themselves and yet another donned the ritual gear and anointed themselves with oil. 
 Beneath the stoic resolve, however, doubt had begun to creep in. Three days had passed with no change in the heart. Even now glances were exchanged. Questions asked and answered in silence lest the more zealous catch wind. A handful had even begun to gather their belongings. 
 “Just in case” they tol…</span>

 Boomtopia is a city of explosive opportunity and the newly founded capital of Boom, the jewel of the empire. And we want you to be part of it. Whether you’re opening a tavern, a shop, a guild hall, or an embassy, there’s a place for you in the heart of magic and mayhem. “We have created peace, freedom, and security for our new empire.” Said Anna Kin (27) “Wow, stuff here is cool” -Boy (6) “Goo goo Ga ga” -Baby gremlin (509) /uw, you don&#x27;t need to be an Empire of boom member to move here, you can just set up shop. Thought it&#x27;d be cool to have an actual place instead of just ‘anywhere and nowhere.’ Hopefully someone comes up with some wacky ideas to build here!
