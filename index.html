 Employee2: Sometimes you disgust me....have you tried touching grass or socialising?
 Employee1: I tried, people is scared of me for practicing necromancy...
 The employee tries to place a box full of doccuments on a shelf, but he falls from the stairs he was on
 Employee2: Hey man!, you good?
 Employee1: Yeah, im ok......huh? Some doccuments have fallen.
 The employee opens one of the folders and reads

 Fuck! These were supposed to be monthly! We just let the devil run the government for HALF A YEAR?!
 Ahem.
 In any case, first step to amending that is holding a gala. Which is to say the Bastion (EON headquarters in the city of Maelstrom) is going to have an open bar and let you scream obscenities at the candidates for Chancellor... er... or ask them questions about policy. 
 Without further ado.

                              <span>Uw/ I&#x27;ve been gone for a while, posting every now and again on Wizposting main. But Kavrala&#x27;s oil corruption arc has ended!
 I&#x27;ve been waiting to share this art for around two months now! There&#x27;s gonna be plenty more to come! And you KNOW I&#x27;ll be drawing more dragons! The Sanctuary is coming back and it&#x27;ll be more diverse than ever!
 All in all, this is just a thank you to everyone who participated in my story arc. Being able to interact with you all as our characters; It makes everything worth it, especially when I agonize over how a sentence sounds or how a drawing looks, lol.
 So to everyone, whether we&#x27;ve spoken to each other or not, thank you.
 It&#x27;s kinda crazy to think that I&#x27;ve been on the sub for three years now. I look back at my first ever post on here and can&#x27;t even believe that Kavrala used to not exist, and that she almost had four arms at one point!
 I love this community.
 Ah, regardless, Kav is no longer an oily abomination! She&#x27;s been cleansed and has some slight amnesia!! I plan on doing posts for her recovery and also to cleanse the land that got destroyed during the arc as well!
 Ah, and enjoy some extra art too, why not?

 /rw
 Arach paces around her office as one of her kin continues to explain the situation. The spider had entered the office already shaking with fear, and anxiety had only worsened since his entrance. He had the unenviable job of telling Arach that her factories had to be temporarily shut down due to issues with disposing the waste they produced. The last messenger who had given her bad news ended up being thrown into her fireplace, so his fear is well warranted. Once he finally finishes speaking Arach stops pacing and begins to inquire.

 I-I-
 Oni thought about himself.
 He has left Flufferson. He&#x27;s left everyone he has known.
 God. Why is the avatar of Wrath this time around...
 Such a god damn pu-
 Alarms.
 Sirens blared as Oni heard the arming of...an army, he supposed.
 That...
 Somehow...He didn&#x27;t feel less horrible.
 Maybe...
 Its for the best.
 Waddel: SHIT! SOMEONE BROKE IN! FLUFFERSON&#x27;S INJURED!
 Waddel was on a walkie talkie with someone.
 Oni: Waddel...call it off.
 Waddel: What?
 Oni: ...I...Just let me do this. One. Simple. Thing.
 But...
 There&#x27;s the thing.
 Even if Flufferson basically disowned him...
 He sure as shit wasn&#x27;t letting Heresy go easy.
 ___
 Heresy was ready.
 The sacrifices were ready, Oni was...probably dead. Who knows.
 And now...
 Time to truly make someone suffer.

                              <span>As the title says, im in a bit of a pickle, my shop seems to have been targeted by another copper merchant. I cannot figure out as to why, but he is using a castle shaped golem to attack my shop. My barrier is currently holding back the physical attacks, im worried about the large canon in the center of the golem. it&#x27;s been charging mana for several minutes now and i don&#x27;t believe my barrier will hold through that much power. do any of you have suggestions as to how to stop or absorb the attack?

The audience had been gathered after all there&#x27;s nothing quite like a continent leveling explosion to attract people&#x27;s attention.
