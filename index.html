                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently been casting several curses that aren&#x27;t directly harmful, but evil in their own right. Feel free to take or leave any you see.
 1: Every time the victim stubs their toe, they enter a full ragdoll.
 2: Invisible Legos are placed around the victim.
 3: (Must be casted on victim&#x27;s place of residence) Any time a door is opened, the victim is transported to a completely random spot in the area.
 4: The victim&#x27;s clothes are suddenly backwards.
 5: The victim has the sound of a fly playing in their ear, only to realize it&#x27;s not actually there.
 6: Whenever the victim wakes up, they are paralyzed for at least 1 hour
 7: (Do be warned, this is labeled as a forbidden spell) Whenever the victim consumes something they know the texture of, it suddenly changes as they eat.
 There are probably more inconvenient Curses I could think of, however I have run out of mana. I&#x27;ll be back.

                              <span>This wand isn&#x27;t particularly potent nor well-crafted. But it has sentimental value to me as the components were gathered by myself over my exile period(military service). I haven&#x27;t really shown this to anybody and it has some lore behind its creation. So here it is.
 The stone was given to me by one of my predecessors as he moved on. He said his predecessor had found it and crafted it into a necklace by fashioning a hole into it. And then my predecessor had engraved runes from a foreign land(chinese letters) onto it which read &quot;lucky stone&quot;. And it&#x27;s said it had served him well as such.
 The body of the wand was found by me during an expedition with my fellow exiles. We were cutting down foliage to make a potential campsite. And for some reason, this one stem was sticking out, both of grou…</span>

 Six mechanical spiders, each equipped with a suit of stealth capabilities, invisibility and runic dissipators (Dissipates thermal, acoustic energy, etc to difficult to detect threshholda) have been dispatched into Guild territory. Their purpose, to figure out why and how the Guild stole the information to create the Lightless Flame detectors they have evidently managed to duplicate. The Spiders operate under the orders of Ithacar’s chief artificer, Kardonk Carvisky. These are the results of their initial campaign.
 . *Frigid Hollow:** It was obvious why it had been given that name. The frigid air whipped through the mountains and down into the sheltered valley that had once been a small mining town. That town had grown over…</span>

                              <span>The tenfold fireball grenade touches off with a blast rivaling a thunderclap. The ground trembles as small chunks of earth are scattered over a wide area, raining down for a few seconds.
 &quot;Wow!&quot; my Simulacrum exclaims, &quot;I only had to deflect a few pebbles, but the pressure wave almost knocked the wind out of me.&quot; It gestures toward the point of impact, &quot;Look, we&#x27;ve even got a crater this time.&quot;
 I look and see a modest crater, about a meter or two across, at the center of an area wiped clean of standing stalks. &quot;That&#x27;s got to be a twenty meter blast diameter at least.&quot; I say, mostly to myself. &quot;We&#x27;re getting somewhere, but it&#x27;s too many layers. The grenade is too big.&quot;
 I sigh, just a bit worn from all the casting. &quot;Besides, the kill radius is still shorter than throwing distance. Multiplicative amplification isn&#x27;t going to cut it.&quot;
 My Simulacrum chimes in saying &quot;Exponential boosting then? Time for the orange resonators?&quot;
 I think for a moment before replying &quot;I guess so, but I&#x27;ll start with a smaller baseline, so things don&#x27;t get out of hand too quickly. I wouldn&#x27;t want to have an unfortunate accident, or misjudge the collateral damage too severely.&quot;

                              <span>I capture a fireball like before, and begin layering barrier after barrier in a nested sphere around the blaze of stored energy. At the sixth layer, my Simulacrum starts to get a bit uneasy.
 &quot;Remind me again why I&#x27;m standing out in the open, when you&#x27;ve got a perfectly good hidey-hole right there?&quot; it shouts to me.
 Without pausing the delicate process I shout back, &quot;I want visual observation of the tests, of course, and I can&#x27;t be the one risking my neck. This one&#x27;s real after all.&quot; After a momentary silence as I layer another abjuration my Simulacrum says &quot;I suppose that&#x27;s true...&quot;
 I carry on to the tenth layer, then decide I&#x27;m satisfied. This time, it takes a few minutes of charging for the outer surface to get hot.
 It&#x27;s almost unweildy in size, a bit more than a cubit across, but I gingerly get in position to launch it as far as I can then warn my Simulacrum. &quot;Get ready! Tenfold fireball in 3, 2, 1!&quot; The red orb goes flying and I duck down into the foxhole.
 I hear my Simulacrum bellowing quickened incantations I easily recognize as the payload arcs through the air, naturally casting my own spells. Mage Armor. Shield. Then it&#x27;s cut off in the middle of Absorb Elements.

                              <span>This had to be the right track.
 Ulrick wandered the forest, his bare feet dug into deep mud. Besides the rustling of trees, not a single noise broke the silence.
 There were many reports from the villages in the surrounding area. An adventurer, probably some kind of barbarian, wandering through, helping people. He was described as someone extremely tall, almost a giant. And despite his appearance, many said he was incredibly kind…
 The final clue was an R&amp;A case, about a boy who killed his brother. Ulrick felt a bit uncomfortable reading that. Reminded him too much of his greatest mistake…
 But the report also held the final clue. Witnesses said the temperature of the room rose to an unnatural degree. This had to be it.
 Soon, the trees became more sparse as he walked on before he arrived in what appeared to be an abandoned town. Among the crumbling houses, Ulrick spotted a large silhouette…
 Hirk was there.
 Good thing he asked the Relief Force to make sure the area is clear of people. Time to correct the mistake of the elections. His own victory.
 From a mass of darkness, his Nightbite great axe manifested into his left hand, before he stepped out among the buildings to greet his friend.
 /uw time of Hirk vs Ulrick duel has arrived
