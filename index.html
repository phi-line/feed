Want to prove your god is as good as you say? Then FIGHT ME. If your god&#x27;s will can&#x27;t take out one of my bodies, then is he even a god?! Come to [insert address here], and take me on! I&#x27;m not in short supply of these bodies!&quot;, and have a picture of the building and of Ace. From there, he waits for a challenger.

 Subject: Strange Red Crystal
 We closed the Archives for a while and inspected the thing. It&#x27;s roughly 30cm in length and has no immediately noticeable dangerous properties. Regardless, we had it carefully packed up and moved to the Geology Section.
 Any attempts to split off a part of the crystal for material testing were unsuccessful, like it&#x27;s indestructible by our regular tools. We didn&#x27;t want to damage it too badly either. At some point, I accidentally held it in my bare hands which l…</span>
