                              <span>After catching wind of the child murder, the blue helmets set up a crime scene, and exhumed the body for necromantic conversation and autopsy. This was met with significant resistance but we were able to distract with enough reinforcement.
 Name: Jane Doe Sex: female Age: 12 Pre-existing conditions: none
 Findings:
 The suspect held Jane Doe by the top of the head, then closed their hand with extreme force, causing Jane Doe&#x27;s skull then head to be near liquefied from the pressure. Then Jane Doe fell several hundred meters, landing on her back, But she was obviously dead before that.
 Attempts at repairing the soul has proven unsuccessful so necromantic conversation is impossible at this time.
 Reconstruction of the face has yielded inconclusive results about Jane Doe&#x27;s identity.
 We could not find matching dental records or matching DNA or mana print profiles to identify the child.
 The child was found in a deep unmarked grave next to the crime scene. The headstone read &quot;here lies the one I failed to protect&quot;
 DNA and mana print profile testing for the suspect are currently ongoing. Prime suspect is a being we fought, about waist hight, resembling a blonde maid with twin pigtails wearing a pink maid uniform. They appear to be a mana a.i. construct.
 The being escaped before we could capture them.
 An image of the suspect at large is provided in the third slide.
 If you have any information regarding this case please reach out as soon as possible.

                              <span>The elevator chimed softly as it arrived at the ground floor of The Company’s headquarters. From the outside, the building looked like any other corporate tower—clean glass panels, polished metal doors, and a steady stream of employees coming and going with coffee cups in hand. 
 Inside, the lobby buzzed with the hum of conversation. Desks were neatly arranged, plants thrived under gentle lighting, and a friendly receptionist greeted arrivals. It felt almost comforting, like any bustling office environment. One could easily forget the rumors about what happened on the upper floors. 
 But not everyone could forget. The new hire, a young woman who had only been with The Company for a few months, clutched a single slip of paper in her trembling hands. It bore a simple message:

If you want to know the prizes it&#x27;s rather simple first place will receive either 1000 gold or a commission of equal value. Second place will receive 500 gold or equivalent commission. Third place will receive 100 gold or equivalent. Rules are simple no killing and the match only ends if one of three things happens a combatant is knocked out of the ring, someone is knocked out and can&#x27;t fight anymore and if someone surrenders

                              <span>Lianna sat in her hospital room alone and was filled with a melancholic boredom; it was likely sometime around midnight judging by the moonlight being reflected by the statues in her room. She wanted to pick one up and examine it but was having issues controlling the strength of her telekinesis. She only meant to halfway embed the spoon into the masonry not nearly completely. She was worried that if she tried to use telekinesis on one she might accidentally break it. The psychic emanations from them give us soothing suppressant effect to the thoughts that it placed her in her current state. Her self-destructive thoughts refusing to manifest as their root cause is drowned out by waves of “good vibes.”

 But that is not what she saw... all she saw was...
 A Monster.
 She knew what was below that deceptive facade... 
 She knew what she was... a man eater, a Jorōgumo. A golden orb weaver who had lived for far too long... now possessing the ability to take on a human form... A shapeshifter... a predator of man, rather than insect. She was a Yōkai... and she hated it.

                              <span>If one didn&#x27;t know Drakeem and Ithacar were allied the following scene would look very much like an all out invasion. The sky outside the city is filled with Drakeem forces, recent revolutions in mana stone technology used to project the Empires symbol on its Airfleet.
 Light aircraft keep landing people outside of Ithacar. Their origin is the Drakeem Airforce hovering in the sky. The presence of these Zepplins and Airships calls for some questions about the kinds of allies Ithacar is keeping company.
 The dropships only stop arriving after a decently sized group has been landed. In the middle of it all is Hazema, Empress of Drakeem, aswell as some of her court. The rest of this diplomatic envoy is made up out of bodyguards, or rather soldiers. They form a protective barrier around the Drakeem royalty as they make their way to the city gates.
 Some of the landed soldiers don&#x27;t have horns, which is unusual as Drakeems soldiers are almost exclusively clones. These odd bunch are heading to the embassy instead of staying with the royal posse.
 /uw second image is about what the zeppelins look like, first is because I ran out of drawings a long time ago 😭
