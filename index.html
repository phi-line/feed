 Down, down, down it goes—the lone Johnbot, sent by its creator on a mission of dire importance. Past even the Ninth Circle of Hell, the construct descends into the Pit—the namesake of Hell’s most formidable fiends. It’s almost like a miniature version of the Nine Circles, each section dedicated to a different stage in the perfection of law and malice.
 But delve too deep, and chaos begins to unfold. Locusts the size of horses, with scales of iron and faces of men, ravage the lower levels, awaiting the day of Armageddon to rise and consume all sinners. So fierce are these beasts of Hell that only one being could muster them—and the Johnbot had come to visit that man in particular: Abaddon, angel of the Abyss, Lord of the Pit, devil of the Apocalypse.

                              <span>The Occult source of magic is enigmatic and deeply rooted in the ingenuity, ambition, and willpower of mortals. Unlike other sources that are inherent or divine in origin, Occult magic is a construct of mortal creativity, a product of ritual, symbols, and collective belief. It is as much about the unseen forces in the world as it is about the ingenuity of those who dare to reach for power beyond their natural means. Let’s break it down:
 The Core of Occult Magic: The Mortal Forge
 At its heart, the Occult is magic born from mortals themselves. It does not stem from a god&#x27;s will, a personal spark, or the world around them, but from mortal knowledge and their relentless determination to bend reality to their will. 
 Ritualistic Power:
 Occult magic relies heavily on rituals, symbols, incanta…</span>

                              <span>The Primal source of magic is the oldest and most untamed of the four. It is a force that lies outside the self, emanating from the natural world and the cosmic wilderness. Primal magic embodies life’s raw, chaotic energies and the ancient currents that pulse through the earth, sky, and stars. It is magic drawn from without, an unfiltered expression of nature’s power. Let’s explore its depths:
 The Core of Primal Magic: The Wild Pulse
 Primal magic flows from the universe’s living energy—a pulse that resonates in every aspect of existence. Unlike Arcane magic, which comes from within, Primal magic demands that practitioners connect with the world around them, attuning themselves to nature’s rhythm.
 Channels of Primal Magic:
 Primal magic is often found in the elemental forces: fire, water…</span>

                              <span>So these three items are unique pieces that I am putting up for auction. 
 Souls are the only acceptable currency for this auction. The souls are required to be identified with the following information: Name, three greatest feats in life, three greatest abilities in life, and alignment(lawful good, chaotic evil, etc). Value of the souls will be judge by myself. The winner might be a single powerful soul or multiple souls. Please do not submit a flood of souls.(/uw yes I am requiring you to provide a list of actual traits of the souls you are submitting. No saying here is a thousand souls with an unspecified attached list. You will have to get creative with your souls)
 Sapphire of soul protection- this sapphire was once a phylactery. Its beautifully shaped and can contain any type of soul…</span>
