                              <span>My friends! I&#x27;ve found a spell for skipping time. The reagents are you don&#x27;t eat all day. Then, when the sun starts to set channel your mana into a bottle of vodka. Chug is down while ponding your orb. You&#x27;ll feel the room start to spin when the spell is working.

                              <span>*Golem Guardians, Inc. - Disclaimer of Responsibility
 &quot;By acquiring or activating any golem from Golem Guardians, Inc., you, the esteemed wizard, acknowledge and accept full and unyielding responsibility for all actions, reactions, and potential pandemonium that may arise from said golem&#x27;s deployment. This includes, but is certainly not limited to: * Unforeseen Rampages: Should your golem develop an unexpected fondness for smashing local produce stands or engaging in impromptu demolition derbies, Golem Guardians, Inc. accepts precisely zero culpability. * Sentience Surprises: If your golem suddenly develops a penchant for philosophical debates or existential angst, please consult your local arcane therapist, not us. * Accidental Transmutation: Should your golem accidentally turn your prize-winning toad into a teacup (or vice versa), we suggest a strongly worded letter to the golem, as we are not liable. * Misinterpreted Commands: If your golem interprets &quot;fetch&quot; as &quot;rearrange the city skyline,&quot; you&#x27;ll find our customer service line remarkably busy. * Emotional Outbursts: Golems, despite their impenetrable exteriors, can be sensitive. If yours decides to express its feelings by burying your rival wizard in a pile of pebbles, that&#x27;s between you and your local constable.
 In essence, you are the golem&#x27;s master, and thus, its master&#x27;s responsibility. Golem Guardians, Inc. provides the golem; you provide the common sense (hopefully). May your golem serve you well, and may your insurance cover any collateral damage.
 Golem Guardians, Inc. - We build &#x27;em, you break &#x27;em (possibly).&quot;
 Scry yours today!
