                              <span>Time of year to collect cuttings may vary depending on the location and type of grapevine. 
 By using cuttings, growers can make sure that the plants they are growing will make the same quality of grapes. If they were to let the plants reproduce from seed then the resulting plant would be a mix of two different grapevines (we’re going to ignore perfect plants and self pollination for the sake of simplicity) meaning the resulting grapes could be drastically different. 
 Not all plants can be grown from cuttings, if you’re planning to grow your own make sure to do some research! 
 /uw no link today. It’s springtime in the northern hemisphere! Drink water, Go outside, and enjoy the sun and all the plants!

                              <span>Vytsky had been acting rather odd since those trees came up from the ground. He had seemed to just… suddenly switch how he did things outside of his shop. He was out more, attending sermons praising Dominox, chatting with cult members, and even attending some executions.
 This was seriously unlike him. He existed before the universe itself, and yet he believed that Dominox was the one true god? It was obvious he wasn’t being mind-controlled, either. He kept his composure, maintained things at his shop like he always did. Nobody under mind-control could do that. And besides, he’d be pretty resistant against mind-control, too, right? So what the hell was he doing?
 if he was under any specific denomination, it was unclear, as he had been spotted in many places around the world. It was also unclear if he had obtained any new power from being under Dominox, but his glitches had been more common and intense than usual.
 Why? Why do this? What happened to him?
 /uw I’m exhausted and going to bed so you won’t hear from me until I wake up tomorrow morning. I will get notifications though, barring Reddit being stupid. C’yall.

                              <span>An abhorrent curse, especially for those with sensory issues. Everything without exception tastes, smells, and feels like mayonnaise. Even the darkest and foulest of beings fear this curse.
 The one cure being to find the closest jar of mayonnaise, and to eat all of the contents of the mayonnaise jar in one sitting.
 If there is no mayonnaise available to you, after 1 hour the curse becomes permanent.

 Oni crying behind her.
 She tries to shut it out, but...
 The sound of a lord of hell crying is not one that you just forget.
 Flufferson walks forward, turning the handle.
 Locked. Their plan, probably.
 Flufferson kicks down the door.
 Something scuttles to her right.
 Flufferson: ...Heresy?
 Suddenly, the mam himself appears, brandishing a knife.
 Flufferson: SHIT-
 Flufferson dodges a stab, pulling out a break-action pistol.
 Flufferson: Holy rounds? Where is the pouch?
 Heresy stabs again, As Flufferson casts a light spell, slashing at Heresy.
 Heresy: COME HE-
 As Heresy nears the blade of light, he is pushed back, as Flufferson loads, and fires.
 The bullet pierces.
 Heresy: Fuckfuckfuck...fuck.
 ...
 Heresy is...in shock.
 It doesn&#x27;t hurt.
 Heresy: ...
 Flufferson starts backing away.
 Heresy stands there, confused, yet...
 One stab, and its over.
 Flufferson falls.
 uw/If you want to know the song reference this time, it&#x27;s The Protomen&#x27;s title album.
 Act 3 of that will totally come out soon, totally, right?

                              <span>The Conqueror was immense. His power held countless lives on hundreds of realms, and with ever life enslaved, every being forced under his thumb, his power grew. But it wasn&#x27;t his power. Some things are better left unknown. Some things are better left undisturbed. The Gauntlet is one of those things. It&#x27;s past should have remained a mystery, it should have been left in the mountain it was imprisoned in.
 One such being, an ordinary librarian, was unfortunate enough to learn some of the Gauntlets secrets. Far off in a distant realm, there was a town. One day the librarian found a book on one of the shelves, one that shouldn&#x27;t be there. Curious, he opened the book. The words swam across pages, rearranging themselves into sentences at random. It wasn&#x27;t written in any known language, but he co…</span>

 A hand unseen, a tale retold.
 Fate’s strings tighten, unseen they weave,
 A whispered truth none dare believe. 
 The widow strikes, her aim is true, Yet shadows shift, the sky turns blue.
 A story writ before she knew,
 A guiding hand she never drew. 
 The puppet dances, blind to thread,
 A gunshot sings, the sky turns red.
 And far beyond the waking mind,
 A weaver waits, his grasp entwined. 
 Samantha stood at the center of the Council’s grand chamber, her posture steady despite the tension coiling in the air. Around her, the curved rows of seats were packed with officials, wizards, and envoys from distant realms. Since Jester’s death, uncertainty had spread like a contagion.

 Down, down, down it goes—the lone Johnbot, sent by its creator on a mission of dire importance. Past even the Ninth Circle of Hell, the construct descends into the Pit—the namesake of Hell’s most formidable fiends. It’s almost like a miniature version of the Nine Circles, each section dedicated to a different stage in the perfection of law and malice.
 But delve too deep, and chaos begins to unfold. Locusts the size of horses, with scales of iron and faces of men, ravage the lower levels, awaiting the day of Armageddon to rise and consume all sinners. So fierce are these beasts of Hell that only one being could muster them—and the Johnbot had come to visit that man in particular: Abaddon, angel of the Abyss, Lord of the Pit, devil of the Apocalypse.
