                              <span>The Merchant Vesell Firgotten was a trim craft of fine design. Perhaps not the finest to sail the seas but a beautiful and respectable craft of decent repute for its trade in saffron and other expensive and exotic spices. Captain Jon Dough ran a solid crew and while not the most gifted of sailors, was nonetheless a fine captain to work for.
 On this particular evening Captain Dough was worried however. Despite the great distance from land of any kind the Firgotten was surrounded by a massive sandstorm. A sandstorm at sea was a bad omen and all the sailors were muttering it under their breaths so the Captain couldn’t hear them but he knew they were anyways.

 The problem however, is that not matter how much digging (and in this university, rather literally) I do into the university archives, I can&#x27;t find anything about this building anywhere! It&#x27;s like the Secret Salt Mine University doesn&#x27;t want people to know anything about this wizardly tower! Can anyone help me figure out if any kind of spellcaster lives here?

                              <span>I have had it up to HERE with Druidic shenanigans ever since that Dog Wizard raided my tower. I only just reversed my transfiguration from his &quot;Become Orangutan&quot; curse YESTERDAY. There are still fiddler crabs EVERYWHERE. I cannot even use my wizard toilet without my wizardly posterior being pinched by their dastardly claws.
 Today I woke up to find this WRETCHED INTRUDER. I do not know what its foul intentions are but if someone doesn&#x27;t claim this abominable beast in the next 24 hours I am banishing it to Y&#x27;ha-nthlei. Get this treacherous fluffy fiend out of my tower!
