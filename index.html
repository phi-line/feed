The corruption around the eyes of people affected by it was, in essence, solidified dread, an emotion made physical, alongside a physical tether to the torment, which is where all of Dread’s strength came from. It can’t be banished spiritually, given it is physically planted, and can’t be simply ripped off, as more solidified dread would form to keep it together. though something better can be done with this.

 Floating islands with beautiful buildings and flora dotted the skies of the celestial realm. The realm felt at peace. In the grandest of all of these islands sat a complex of many palaces, easily the size of the largest cities in the mortal world.

                              <span>Orbee has been requested to join some group or guild he had no idea was, out of slight curiosity he accepted to join.
 Once in the place he couldn&#x27;t describe well, a house or cottage, he wasn&#x27;t sure. He was ordered to sweep the floor with the broom Orion tossed at him. Orbee tried catching it with manipulation but failed slightly, out of anger from 12 attempts to use it, he shifts into flesh form and geabs the broom nearly cracking it in half. Staring down at it with intense emptiness.
 Orion had been observing and when Orbee noticed, he tried to put on some confused embarrassed face despite barely understanding his own feelings or emotions other than hatred and protection.

                              <span>The battle against the AMCGs main Force was a chaotic clash shot and spell of technological marvels and magical prowess crashing into each other in a swarm of Carnage and suffering. There was no way they could stand against the might brought against them even if they did throw every man or woman and child on the sister of Erebus it would but not be enough. But their Commander had a different purpose for them to have them be sacrificed to feed their suffering to their dreadlord and that they did so splendidly. 
 But as threatening as it was the dreadlord could not hope to stand against the cosmic Arc of the universe, the flow of concordance and order that guides the universe to peace. But even victorious battles leave scars.
