It was understandable, none of the others seemed to have any opinions on him, which was also understandable, he had missed most of their childhoods. He didn&#x27;t really regret it, he needed to make sure Freetown was safe, even if it meant neglecting his adopted kids. Out of all his Draconic children, only Kriid seemed to think of him as a father.
 The two played for hours, it made good practice for Kriids human shapeshifting. Slowly as the sun drifted across the sky, the finer details set in, faint scales in the skin became just skin, the small horns shrank into nothing. Slowly their accuracy increased, Alaric stopped needing to fly to catch the ball.

                              <span>The battle against the AMCGs main Force was a chaotic clash shot and spell of technological marvels and magical prowess crashing into each other in a swarm of Carnage and suffering. There was no way they could stand against the might brought against them even if they did throw every man or woman and child on the sister of Erebus it would but not be enough. But their Commander had a different purpose for them to have them be sacrificed to feed their suffering to their dreadlord and that they did so splendidly. 
 But as threatening as it was the dreadlord could not hope to stand against the cosmic Arc of the universe, the flow of concordance and order that guides the universe to peace. But even victorious battles leave scars.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just been listening to songs that YouTube gave me in a mix and I found a song that I haven&#x27;t heard in ages. I told myself &quot;Man this sounds perfect for Vytsky.&quot;
 And so now, it&#x27;s his theme song lol. I know it&#x27;s real chill, but it&#x27;s not like he battles with it. I haven&#x27;t found something for his battle theme yet.
 I was curious if anyone else had a theme song for their characters.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve walked a thousand shoes to arrive where I am
 I will die on my own two legs, a monument to my calloused hands
 You were born with a thousand feet, and hands as soft as Tyvian Butter
 Yet when I gaze upon your palms, I look in disgust, for I see no blunder
 You were born from the magic, we beat it to submission 
 You were made in resistance to US, OUR jurisdiction
 Trust me, I equipped my wand, but I need no conduit
 For the spell I use on you is so low level, I need only my mouth to conjure it
 I see no passion in your magic, no sacrifice, no art
 For how can flame unfurl from your tongue, if you yourself have no fire in your heart....
