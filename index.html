 A starlit field whispers as the wind whistles through the grass under Beetle&#x27;s boots. He has dressed heavy. Last time he was there, it was bitter cold. Not something he can ignore with his magic. He bites his lip. He conceals his face under a collar and a wide-brimmed hat. Is that enough?
 He takes one look at the sky. He remembers that bright and war-torn city, separated from the rest of the world by a sea of stars just like this one. And above them, even more stars congregated, meshed with smoldering walls as tall as mountains. And under them, a frozen waste, where ships were torn by the ice. And deeper under that, halls of stone and ice that bit at his soul. And under that, where no star could ever reach, no matter how hard it strained, the roots.

 I keep having this weird dream.
 I&#x27;m in the beach with my friends.
 We play and laugh together.
 Then a great wave forms on the horizon.
 I try to run, but my legs refuse to obey.
 The wave keeps getting bigger, covering the sun.
 And then I wake up.
 &quot;Bro is gonna make it!&quot;
 The youths cheered and laughed as Caspian kept climbing the palm tree, he tried to hide his own fear with bravado, but the truth was, he had never been a fan of heights.
 &quot;You better prepare that gem Dylan! I&#x27;m almost at the top!&quot;
 That was the reason why he was doing this, Dylan had an impressive collection of rocks and other baubles he had collected from all across their island, including a particularly nice gem, nice enough to be the perfect present for a certain person.

 One day a group of cavers were gearing up for a spelunking session. They&#x27;d recently found a wonderful cave called the crevice of darkness and despair. A perfect place to go down. One by one they squeezed through the crack in the rock. Instantly they were surrounded in darkness. Not an issue in the slightest, all of them knew basic light spells. They lit up some of spells and looked around.
 Nothing remarkable, big crack on one side of the chamber, a passage further down on the other. They&#x27;d gone in, now they went further. Down the passage they found a sudden drop off into a river. Very strong current. They needed to be careful. Slo…</span>
