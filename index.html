 Not the response I expected. &quot;W- Well, I suppose I wasn&#x27;t happy with how we left off...&quot;
 &quot;No fucking shit! You stabbed me, you dick!&quot; He pulled the collar of his shirt down to reveal an ever-familiar scar on his neck. &quot;And now what— you&#x27;re here after god-knows-how-many years?! What have you been doing all this time?!&quot;
