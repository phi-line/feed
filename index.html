                              <span>Since my arrival to this realm, I&#x27;ve noticed there arent many kitsunes going their day in this realm, and the talks of this... Council, I&#x27;ve seen. It all got me wondering, what is position of kitsunes in this realm and how are they treated, are they treated fairly, and such.
 As a kitsune, I grew interested to know how my beings are treated amongst wizards, witches, sorcerers, necromancers.
 and importantly, what are your thoughts on kitsunes, how do you see them?
 Sincerely, Kohaku.
