 Regardless, he&#x27;s finally arrived. The town of Villthorn... Small, relatively unheard of. Ripe with crime, specifically dealing with slavery... 
 Might as well say the town is ruled by crime. No real government to be heard of... Nothing legitimate at least. Not even a ruthless dictator, like the Phoenix. People have come around and tried to bring order, but... Pests tend to have a way of crawling back in. 
 Regardless, this is where the Lustful Heart is... And so this is where Welnar is staying for the next while. 
 He walks through the streets with caution... But he does not walk meekly. He makes himself as big as he can, flaunting …</span>

                              <span>Kalim huffed in pure annoyance. He needed to recharge the Rod of Resurrection he purchased from Vulkan. To do that he needed Titan’s blood. Ten Suns would trade his Titan’s blood for Leviathan tears. Unfortunately, Kalim didn’t have those but another person had them. Unfortunately that person wanted a bicorn horn. To get the bicorn horn though Kalim would need rainbow pearls. Unfortunately the person with the rainbow pearls wanted the power of Gaia…
 Kalim was quite irritated by the busywork of a CHAINED FETCH QUEST. Seriously he was a fiend from the Nine Hells and not even he was that sadistic. He would track down whatever soul invented the idea of the chained fetch quest and make sure that soul ceased to exist. They were probably already in the Nine Hells for their sadism anyways.
 Kalim stalked along and then paused. Wait a minute… KALIM KNEW A TITAN ALREADY! With tears of joy the Rakshasa flew off to find Atlas and asking for a drop of blood, leaving the Chained Fetch Quest from beyond Hell behind. An hour later he had the blood, which he traded for with Atlas the Titan in exchange for the last bottle of 774 Lemarcia red wine. Expensive? Yes, but so worth it to skip the stupid, stupid, stupid CHAINED FETCH QUEST. Now he just had to find the extixnct race of gem folk that was the target of his Rod of Resurrection.
 Oh and find a specific soul to rend apart.

 “I’ll make us a quick portal” 
 Ж begins to open a portal to Calarakis, before successfully opening one right to the center of the town.
 the two walk through the portal
 “The core elevator is right there, let’s go. Unless you want to stay here due to the antimagic.”
 “let&#x27;s go...my body isn&#x27;t the only thing that&#x27;s stronger while i&#x27;m like this.” Alisa says as she sighs
 “Alright then, I called the assistant earlier, so it should’ve been found, but I got no response that he got it” Ж notes
 “concerning...lets check there first i suppose?” Alisa replies
