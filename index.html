 “Our realm should reflect us,” he had argued. 
 They had agreed, and so the Dragon Well had been created, a massive font of power designed to replace the natural leylines that had been severed during Haven’s shift into a more defensible Demiplane. 
 The intent behind this was twofold: 
 Firstly, many dragons, including himself, subsisted on the ambient mana produced by leylines and, to a lesser extent, inefficiently cast spells. When such mana was plentiful this ability could even completely remove the need to obtain sustenance from physical sources. Where this particular ability came from was hotly debated, but few could deny its obvious benefits.

 “What was that!” Vince shouted out staring off into the distance of the sea. There was not one sound after that hit. I looked around where I had seen the swirls in the first place. I felt something, a spite, a strong hate and anger. 
  
 “Pilot?” Liam looked at me with slight fear, I felt like he knew what I felt and knew what it was, his ears pinned down and his tail twitching right under his legs, he was like a scared dog.

 That, in and of itself, was not a problem. He had been dead before, for much the same reasons. Picking a fight beyond his capacity, it seemed, was in danger of becoming a habit. 
 A habit he could have immediately made plans to correct if not for one simple problem: He was not where he was supposed to be. The towering gothic edifices of the Shadowfell were nowhere to be seen. 
 He stood, instead, in a long hallway carved from a black stone he could not identify. Between the arches lay murals. 
 No, not murals, he realized as he stared at the sight before him. Glass. Cracked and distorted. He raised a talon and touched the pane, the sight behind it somehow familiar. The glass shattered into fragments, revealing an image so lifelike he could swear that a single step would…</span>

 Catherine Louise, Council Head of Research and Development, was not going to be one of these cases.
 While she has not made an official statement, or official appearance, many clerics offices have found reoccurring visits from the council woman. No fanfare, no media, she just volunteered her time. She would work her shift, help with curing or treating any cursed individual who was there, and once her time was up she moved to her next task.

 He has to take a few moments to catch his breath. In only a few moments from chatting with an old friend he avoided because he feared the village would be in danger. Found out a boy he helped teach how to hold a blade and how to wield it with purpose, killed by his brother.

 Jay and Thomas were packing their things in the Inn they were staying at. A few weeks ago the Archbishop of the colony had brought them to the northern island to train Jay in the basics of magic. Now they were preparing their trip back home. Overall it was fairly uneventful. As they left the city of New Riverguard, Jay could hear people talking about how someone named Kanthar was visiting the city today. Apparently he was the person in charge of all the islands.
 As their ship sailed away back home, Jay could see as an airship made of metal lan…</span>

 No one was certain what happened to the Bloody Butcher to make him the way he was, very few wanted to know. The first time anyone heard of him was thirty years before the Conqueror arrived, a son flew home from school one day to find both parents in peices hanging from the roof and decorating the walls. Then the son heard a noise from the kitchen, a noise like someone eating cheese like their life depended on it.

 Going inside she casts detect magic detecting something in the middle of the temple. She starts walking towards it activating a series of traps on the way there.
 She reaches the middle of the temple with burned robes and an arrow through her hat. In the middle there&#x27;s a pedestal with a potion on it, apon further inspection the potion has a label &quot;age giving potion&quot; 
 Oriana: sweet!
 She takes the potion and the pedestal goes down. After it goes fully down a curse comes out in a form of mist, completely surrounding her. After a bit the mist disappears and Orioana isn&#x27;t quite there anymore.
 Orion: I&#x27;m back! Let&#x27;s go!
 Noiro in Orion&#x27;s brain: that&#x27;s nice, wait...
 Oriana in Orion&#x27;s brain: what is this place? Why is it full of catgirls?
 Noiro: oh no she&#x27;s here...
 Oriana: who are you? You look like me, but you&#x27;re a guy
 Noiro: I&#x27;m Orion&#x27;s &quot;evil&quot; version, it seems you&#x27;re now stuck with me in his brain 
 Oriana: I&#x27;m fine with that sweetheart~
 Noiro: noooooooooo

                              <span>Think of it, the only bound on your bagic being the spells you know and the time in the day you have to cast them. What would you spend your day doing? 
 I have crossed that line long ago where mana intake is far more than my output could be if I was casting 24/7 so I want a fresh take from wizards that are still working out an answer. I find how each school of magic tends to answer this with a new perspective each generation of wizards that are born to take on the line of teaching.
