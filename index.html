                              <span>Even since I was a mere apprentice, I thought that an urban wizard of particularly evil nature must live here. I mean, for all magic, it&#x27;s called the Book Tower!
 The problem however, is that not matter how much digging (and in this university, rather literally) I do into the university archives, I can&#x27;t find anything about this building anywhere! It&#x27;s like the Secret Salt Mine University doesn&#x27;t want people to know anything about this wizardly tower! Can anyone help me figure out if any kind of spellcaster lives here?
