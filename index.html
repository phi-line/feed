                              <span>Geralt walks out of a potion store, as he holds a bag of goods.
 Geralt: ...I think I have everything. At least one of everything. If we&#x27;re doing a ritual, I don&#x27;t think I need more than this.
 Geralt looks at the steps behind him.
 A blood red print follows him.
 Geralt: Bloody hell. I knew we should have waited till night. Poor bloke of a shopkeep...
 Geralt kicks his feet around in the dirt, before going on.
 Nothing matters.
 Not anymore.
 Geralt walks away, up to the hill...
 Seeing Envy.
 Envy: H-h-hey, Geralt.
 Geralt: ...Why are you here?
 Envy: I-I-I wanted to tell you so-something.
 Geralt: What? I&#x27;m busy.
 Envy: O-oh, am I a b-bother?
 Envy hangs her head.
 Geralt: NO! NO! IT&#x27;S NOT LIKE THAT!
 Envy: ...Well, uh...I l-li-like you.
 Envy&#x27;s face changes cibstantly as she says this, blushing.
 Geralt: Placing down the bag of ingredients. I like you too.
 Envy perks up.
 Envy: Re-REALLY-Y?
 Envy gets closer, hoping to go for a hug.
 But Geralt falls over.
 A knife in his back.
 ____
 Oni looks around, as he opens the Penguinfantry armory.
 Oni: Any-cough actual weapons?
 Waddel: You need aid. I can handle Fluff.
 Oni: Shut up, I&#x27;m BUILT for combat. This is noth- COUGH -Oh god, there&#x27;s blood.
 Waddel: Obviously not, then. Rolling eyes.
 Oni: I&#x27;m Fluff&#x27;s brother, I know her better than anyone.
 Waddel: If you get stabbed, I&#x27;m not healing you.
 Oni: Its not holy, I won&#x27;t DIE. I&#x27;ll just feel like I am.
 Waddel: That&#x27;s the same thing.
 Oni: It ISN&#x27;T. ...Technically.
 Waddel throws a pistol, and grabs an SMG.
 Waddel: Your call, birdbrain.
 Oni: That&#x27;s you and Fluff.
 Waddel: ...Are you sure you&#x27;re not lord of anger?

My heart pounded.
 I’m scared.
  
 …
  
 (Stalz&#x27;s POV)
  
 I managed to sail the crew away, but one. That was the fish, he&#x27;s new, so why should I care, why did I care, better one man down than my crew down. No. I can’t just leave anyone behind, even if they JUST joined. 
  
 I stare back, to see how he was doing, but there was nothing, the dragon wasn’t there nor was that fish, I felt worried. 
  
 “Liam, can you go check on him!” I shouted at the shark, anxious of our new friend’s life.

                              <span>Out of all the countless lives enslaved by the Conqueror, none bent the knee quite the same as one individual. Most either fought back or joined out of fear, some saw an opportunity for power and took it. Yet in Threndal, there was one who looked into the eyes of the Conqueror, one who commanded more soldiers than there were blades of grass in the realm, and felt no fear.
 Feldrin was a strange soul, from the very beginning of her life she could conjure creatures to do her bidding. For two hundred years she refined her skill, slowly learning to conjure more and more creatures. Controlling more and more powerful creatures. People say that with great power comes great responsibility, Feldrin didn&#x27;t believe so. She believed that with great power came no responsibility. She learned to bind cre…</span>

 వ was wandering through, nothing, for who knows how long. He hadn’t seen another person for so long. No other voice in his head either.
 he was just, walking, on a cold, ashen, ground, for what felt like months. Though in actuality it had only been a few minutes, he didn’t know.
 looking closely, వ saw faint red dust in the air, neon in color. Core radiation. What had happened here? Not like he knew. 
 So, he walked. For what felt like eternity
 At one point, he thought he saw a cliff in the distance, in this, endless, deserted, gravel landscape, but after blinking a few times, it was gone.
 Eventually, he found something. A small hatch in the ground, only barely covered up by the dust on the ground
 “Finally, something”
 flipping open the hatch, వ descends a stairway. It’s a dusty space, filled primarily with monitors. Powered by, a battery? Seems it can run for a while.
 powering it up, it booted up to a log-on screen of, Calarakis?
 “Oh, I remember now.” he said aloud, as he unlocked the computer. It led to a backup of various files from throughout the city. Latest dating to… doesn’t even know how long ago. It’s been just, walking, for so long that the day had been forgotten. Checking the system time led it to… today? No, that can’t be right.
 Click-click.
 it’s a shot of the inside of the Core system, it showcases readings on the left. Instability, graphs overloading, then-
 white
 the camera dies.
 “So. If the world isn’t dead, I’m still probably going to die here. I can’t cast any magic with this in the air. How did I even get here? How did I survive?”
 deciding to focus on more pragmatic efforts, he comes to the obvious conclusion.
 “Very little chance I’m going to be seen. Probably would’ve been found by now if I have.”
 he sulks into the chair, as it creaks with him leaning backward.
 /uw all of this is a dream, if your character can enter dreams, they can find him. Ж’s currently wandering, just like in the other post.

                              <span>It was a year ago where I summoned myself a welcoming taco and it shall be today where I summon myself a graduation taco.
 It was a ...strange year here in this sub with many ups and downs, incredible amounts of joy but also heartbreak which I managed to overcome thanks to the help of others, some very valuable insight on myself and the chance to meet incredible friends along the way which I hold very close to me.
 ...but I think it is time to make it official. This is my last post on WP and its related subs. For the related chats I am in I will stay in as I like the community behind them very much. It stopped being fun and to be fair, I&#x27;m surprised that I even made it this long.
 Anyhow, before this takes on a huge scale I will head out and enjoy the taco.
 Have yourself a good one and a final Logotu out :3
