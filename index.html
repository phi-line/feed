 Checks notes
 Fuck! These were supposed to be monthly! We just let the devil run the government for HALF A YEAR?!
 Ahem.
 In any case, first step to amending that is holding a gala. Which is to say the Bastion (EON headquarters in the city of Maelstrom) is going to have an open bar and let you scream obscenities at the candidates for Chancellor... er... or ask them questions about policy. 
 Without further ado.

                              <span>Uw/ I&#x27;ve been gone for a while, posting every now and again on Wizposting main. But Kavrala&#x27;s oil corruption arc has ended!
 I&#x27;ve been waiting to share this art for around two months now! There&#x27;s gonna be plenty more to come! And you KNOW I&#x27;ll be drawing more dragons! The Sanctuary is coming back and it&#x27;ll be more diverse than ever!
 All in all, this is just a thank you to everyone who participated in my story arc. Being able to interact with you all as our characters; It makes everything worth it, especially when I agonize over how a sentence sounds or how a drawing looks, lol.
 So to everyone, whether we&#x27;ve spoken to each other or not, thank you.
 It&#x27;s kinda crazy to think that I&#x27;ve been on the sub for three years now. I look back at my first ever post on here and can&#x27;t even believe that Kavrala used to not exist, and that she almost had four arms at one point!
 I love this community.
 Ah, regardless, Kav is no longer an oily abomination! She&#x27;s been cleansed and has some slight amnesia!! I plan on doing posts for her recovery and also to cleanse the land that got destroyed during the arc as well!
 Ah, and enjoy some extra art too, why not?

 Arach paces around her office as one of her kin continues to explain the situation. The spider had entered the office already shaking with fear, and anxiety had only worsened since his entrance. He had the unenviable job of telling Arach that her factories had to be temporarily shut down due to issues with disposing the waste they produced. The last messenger who had given her bad news ended up being thrown into her fireplace, so his fear is well warranted. Once he finally finishes speaking Arach stops pacing and begins to inquire.
