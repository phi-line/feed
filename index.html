                              <span>The way through treacherous weather in the woods would&#x27;ve been rough to walk knee deep snow, walking was difficult and yet there were dangers beneath the snow, slippery ice and rocks hidden bemeath the fluffy nd crunchy layers of snow.. The Northern lights glowed in the cloudless night sky amongst the moon as they reflected from frozen puddles of ice.. 
 However as one reached a downhill, they would&#x27;ve been met by an onsen, in midst of nowhere, but seemed to have some activity as there were lights on as the wind had calmed down. As one entered the onsen, they were welcomed by warmth and smell of burning pine and sense of rest. But then a woman appeared from behind some curtains in a kimono with diamond patterns, her hair was white, as it flew behind her back over kimono, her eyes golden, a big and fluffy tail showed itself from beneath the kimono behind her, her fox ears twitched on top of her head. 
 &quot;Ah, customers..&quot; 
 a warm smile appeared over her face.
 &quot;There havent been many customers for centuries,baths are open, rooms open. Would you like to rest and relax here before you continue your journeys?&quot;
 The kitsune asked with welcoming and warm smile..

 Eukarya’s night sky is a beautiful sight that is inescapable. Once Shadeholme conquered the colony under Sylvane, a smaller Well of Shadows was constructed on a metal platform in the middle of the Silver Bay. It was that day Sylvane declared the Shadeholme confederation into the Ce’Darian Empire, and ever since that day the Well there has remained active.
