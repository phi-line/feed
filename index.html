                              <span>/uw If you want context, see here and here, as well as optionally here. Aside from this, just know that Kyrona’s mentor is an assassin who’s also a Druid. 
 /rw Kyrona sat in a library in her city that was the manifestation of the mind of an strange immortal being. The library grew on its own, and filled with knowledge collected by the creature. Technically it wasn’t the safest space to go after a shouting match with one’s mentor, but it would do so long as she kept it fed with informational books. The library was bent solely on the gathering of knowledge, regardless of the morality of its attempts to do so, though its selection sometimes seemed lacking. It had only a single chapter on Druids in the whole of its thousands of books on billions of shelves, but that paled in comparison to the two footnotes they had on artificers.
 The ever moving walkways of the library drifted towards the back again, taking Kyrona with them, trying to close the bookshelves around her. The 15-year old Druid tossed it a cookbook, and the library abated, satisfied. 
 Her girlfriend, Sapphire came in just then. “I have bad news and I have worse news. Which do you want to hear first?” “The bad news.” “The bad news is that my secret’s out. The worse news is that your mentor just framed you for 17 different murders. He might also have been behind my secret being out, he did find out about it.” Kyrona fumed. Did he do this because she had yelled at him? Was he truly that petty. Perhaps Kyrona needed to have a chat with her mentor. She prepared as many offensive spells as she could, and then ran after him. He would pay for this.

 They had surprisingly much freedom after that weird creature their oppressor called master visited. They weren&#x27;t even checked for anything when they went outside be it for shopping or anything else. This made it quite easy for Anais to find some coconspirators to help get her a weapon that should definitely take care of this phony Empress.
 She sold her favorite earrings to buy a submachine gun, it was better to be safe then sorry. Additionally she sold an amulet her father gave her to buy ammunition, one magazine was sufficient she supposed. She very much knew she was getting ripped off i…</span>

 Ten billion, of the fourty billion humans that have died without a sanctified burial, or that are not in hell have been cleared with passports to the living world. 
 They will be offered citizenship to my lands for surface in my army, but those that dont take the offer are free to walk the earth. Updates to translation spells are being put into place to make to ease communication with the dead languages they speak. 
 I have givin them a small amount of gold to pay thier way u till they get on thier feet, but its largly up to them to find a way to pay for a propper burial once they inevitably are bored of the mortal world and want to rest once more in an appropriate here after. 
 The limbo they are comming from does not get netflix, So I expect them to respect border control rather than be sent back, and immigration services and have set a command undead symbol on the gate they came through to make sure they comply with authorities.

 Heresy: Hey, Envy~
 Envy heard Heresy&#x27;s voice creaking down her neck.
 Heresy: Now, this next part&#x27;s going to be VERY important. Okay? Got it?
 Envy nodded, unable to speak
 Heresy: Okay, so...Geralt isn&#x27;t dead! Yay!
 *Envy tried to turn around, but Heresy made her look forward at Geralt&#x27;s body.?
 Heresy: Holy weapons CAN&#x27;T kill humans! Or penguins. So, your crush is fine. Just sit down, and wait.
 Heresy&#x27;s illusion fades, as a ritual, and a few chairs, shows up. Envy sits down, as Heresy ties her and Geralt to chairs.
 Heresy: See! You&#x27;re together! Anyways, I have to make sure a couple steps were done correctly, so...stay there!
 Heresy leaves for the Penguinfantry base, leaving Envy and Geralt alone.
 ____
 Oni looks around.
 Oni: Do you guys have ANY way to track who&#x27;s in the base, and where?
 Waddel: Punchcards on the toilets.
 Oni: ...Are you sure you&#x27;re the good guys?
 Waddel: Well, we helped save Earth&#x27;s Embrace, so...
 Oni: You know that place is loaded to the ass with magic, right?
 Waddel: Fuck off.
 Oni: How much are you getting paid for this?
 Waddel: ...Wait, I see Fluff.
 Oni: On what?
 Waddel dives behind cover as a beam of light nearly hits Oni in the head.
 Oni: ...You suck.
 Oni turns to see Flufferson. Oni walks out of cover.
 Oni: Fluff?
 Flufferson: WHAT?
 Oni: I know this is hard on you, but...
 Flufferson looks at Oni, a pained expression on her face.
 Flufferson: How can I even trust you? We ARE family. And you decided to side with Heresy?
 Oni: Okay, take a deep breath...And realize, no offense...how dumb that sounds.
 Flufferson: ...You are an idiot.
 Flufferson fires a shot of light...
 But it misses, as Flufferson walks away.
 Flufferson: Never see me again, brother.
 And Oni...
 Couldn&#x27;t say anything, as he stood there and watched.
 Tears forming in his eyes.

                              <span>I (m. Mid fourties) am a powerful pyromancer and i finally figured out a way to bring my father&#x27;s (necromancer, m. Over 100) memories back after my brother (artificer, m, mid fourties) stole them and neutralized his powers.
 All my father can talk about is how much better my brother is, and that im a failure for taking this long to restore him. Now he&#x27;s taking over the world with zombies and im sitting pissed off in my manor, 
 Any advice?
