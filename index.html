                              <span>It’s hard to believe, but it was only back in the early 1990s that we discovered the very first planet orbiting a star other than our own Sun. Fast forward to the present day, here in 2025, and we’re closing in on 6000 confirmed exoplanets, found and measured through multiple techinques: the transit method, the stellar wobble method, and even direct imaging. That last one is so profoundly exciting because it gives us hope that, someday soon, we might be able to take direct images of Earth-like worlds, some of which may even be inhabited.



Although it may be a long time before we can get an exoplanet image as high-resolution as even the ultra-distant “pale blue dot” photo that Voyager took of Earth so many decades ago, the fact remains that science is advancing rapidly, and things that seemed impossible mere decades ago now reflect today’s reality. And the people driving this fascinating field forward the most are the mostly unheralded workhorses of the fields of physics and astronomy: the early-career researchers, like grad students and postdocs, who are just beginning to establish themselves as scientists.



In this fascinating conversation with Dr. Kielan Hoch of Space Telescope Science Institute, we take a long walk at the current frontiers of science and peek over the horizon: looking at the good, the bad, and the ugly of what we’re facing here in 2025. It’s a conversation that might make you hopeful, angry, and optimistic all at the same time. After all, it’s your Universe too; don’t you want to know what comes next?

My grandmother, Narmada Lakhani, passed away earlier this year aged 92. Well, we think she was 92, but no one recorded her birth date, so we can only estimate. What we do know about her, though, is that she had a very cheeky laugh, and that she loved lager tops, penny slot machines and tucking £10 notes down her bra, ready to hand out to an unsuspecting grandchild as a gift. She never asked if I was happy, only if I’d eaten well, which I assume to her were the same thing. At this time of year, eating well for her meant tucking into sweetcorn, so, in her memory, I’m going to do the same.

                              <span>When most scientists talk about progress in their field, they speak about small, incremental changes that slightly, gradually improve our understanding of how the Universe works. But when we think about the biggest advances in scientific history, they often occur in revolutionary leaps, completely overthrowing our previously held views of how the Universe works. In particular, revolutions like Special Relativity and General Relativity, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, and the Big Bang and cosmic inflation completely overthrew our prior picture of how things actually behave. As the “holy grail” of physics, many have long sought a Theory of Everything, seeking to explain every particle, phenomenon, and interaction in all the Universe within a single framework, and possibly even wi…</span>

                              <span>The Mediterranean Sea connects to the vastness of the Atlantic through the smallest of natural channels: The Strait of Gibraltar is only about 8 miles wide. People have swum across the Strait, and it is easy to see from Spain to Morocco on a normal, clear day. It seems like it would not take much for nature to simply close that connection between Europe and Africa, and in so doing isolate the Mediterranean Sea. Indeed, this has happened before.
About six million years ago, something caused the Mediterranean to be cut off. Perhaps it was an ice age that decreased the sea level enough to leave a land bridge between Spain and Morocco. The Mediterranean’s isolation could also have been the outcome of tectonic processes. 
In what is dubbed the Messinian salinity crisis, the Mediterranean Sea th…</span>

                              <span>I’ve been a longtime fan of the Art of Quality podcast, so it was a joy to join the show and share some of my Outlast research. Host and investor John Candeto — whom you may remember from our Long Game discussion on power laws — pressed me on why I’ve been traveling the world to study companies that endure: from London’s Lloyd’s and Lock &amp; Co., to Italy’s Riva, Beretta, and Giusti, to Japan’s Tsuen Tea and Hōshi Ryokan.
At the heart of it is this: for me, studying the past provides a living playbook for how to build systems that can withstand shocks and endure for generations. And the high-level pattern emerging across my research is clear: longevity comes from honoring tradition while evolving slowly, and centering trust with employees and communities.
These lessons, I believe, hold as mu…</span>

Our current criteria for intelligence might be too narrow. Here’s what that means for the search for extraterrestrial life.

                              <span>If you look at all the objects detectable in Earth’s skies, including both naturally occurring bodies as well as artificial satellites, it should come as no surprise that the Sun appears as the brightest object of all. The Sun, after all, produces its own light, sustainably powered by nuclear fusion in its core. That core-generated energy helps keep the Sun from contracting under its own gravitation, but also propagates to the Sun’s edge, the photosphere, where the Sun emits radiation over a wide range of wavelengths that correspond to a temperature of around 6000 K. Although the Moon is the second-brightest object in most wavelengths of light, it only appears so bright because of its very close proximity to Earth. From an intrinsic point of view, most of the Moon’s light is merely reflect…</span>

                              <span>Human beings are deliberative creatures. We weigh things up all the time. At its most basic level, we weigh up what we enjoy. You open the fridge at dinner time and think, “Hey, I’m in a pasta kind of mood tonight.” You turn on Netflix and scroll through hundreds of movies before choosing one that suits. This thing will give me more satisfaction and pleasure than that thing.
The problem, though, is that weighing up pros and cons is not locked into the moment. The pleasure of an act might echo out into the future in happy, contented ripples. That movie might be so good that you’ll talk about it with friends or join a Reddit group dedicated to appreciating it. At other times, the indulgence of the now might lead to great pain in the future. Binging pasta might lead to a stomach ache and terr…</span>

According to their research, by choosing new experiences today, we can reshape how our past influences us, gain more control over our feelings, and create new possibilities for connection and growth.

the fact that it emits its own infrared radiation, making it the only planet to emit more light on its own than it reflects from the Sun,
the fact that it has the largest effect, of any planet, on the wobbling orbit of our parent star,
the fact that it’s well-separated from our parent star, making it an easier target for direct imaging than any of the rocky planets,
and the fact that, if viewed from afar at the right perspective, it would block more of the Sun’s light than any other planet during a transit event.
Earth may be of interest to us, since we live on it, but to an external observer, our Solar System…</span>

“(Mercator) is the world’s longest misinformation and disinformation campaign, and it just simply has to stop,” Moky Makura, executive director of advocacy group Africa No Filter, told Reuters. The group champions the introduction of the Equal Earth projection, which aims to give Africa its magnitudinal due.

                              <span>Earlier this year, Bloom Books canceled the release of best-selling author Sophie Lark’s new romance novel, Sparrow and Vine. The decision came after advance copies met an online backlash regarding a character readers argued was racist, MAGA-coded, and fangirled over Elon Musk (persona non grata of the progressive left for, well, obvious reasons).
In response, Lark posted a statement on Instagram. While the statement has since been removed, according to reporting at the time, Lark apologized and promised to revisit the book “to ensure that [her] work doesn’t contribute to harm” and listen “more closely to our sensitivity readers” in the future.

                              <span>Even on the slow route to the intelligence explosion, big tech plays a vital role: they advance AI as fast as they can without safeguards. [Cognitive scientist and AI existential safety researcher] Peter Park said, “Big tech has boatloads of money and boatloads of lobbyists, but big tech also has admitted, either implicitly or explicitly, that their goal is to reduce the economic leverage of humans to zero. And they don’t have a plan to ensure humans’ ability to advocate for their rights and interests, which will go to zero soon after their economic leverage goes to zero.”
And how does our economic leverage go to zero? When we lose our jobs, our money, and with them our ability to influence lobbies and politicians. Despite their seeming innocuousness, chatbots and image generators have alr…</span>

When AOL completed its acquisition of Netscape in March 1999, a part of the old web died forever. By the end of the year (and the century), Netscape&#x27;s share of the browser market had shrunk to about 20% and Microsoft&#x27;s Internet Explorer had become dominant.
Meanwhile, the dot-com bubble continued to expand, with IPOs from Nvidia (now the world&#x27;s most valuable company), Netscape co-founder Jim Clark&#x27;s Healtheon, priceline.com, Ask Jeeves, Red Hat, TiVo, Akamai and others. Also, Google received its first VC funding round in June and declared its bold goal “to organize the world’s information, making it universally accessible and useful.”

began with a period of cosmic inflation that preceded and set up the hot Big Bang,
then the hot Big Bang occurred, creating a dense, hot, mostly uniform Universe,
containing normal matter and radiation, but dominated by dark matter and dark energy,
which gravitated, expanded, and cooled,
forming the light elements, neutral atoms, stars, galaxies, and black holes,
and giving rise to the Universe as we observe it today.

                              <span>When I was sixteen, I asked my parents for a copy of Niccolò Machiavelli’s classic Renaissance-era book The Prince as my Christmas present. It might seem strange, but I’d just read an excerpt in history class, and it had sounded like perfect reading for any young person looking to make their way in the world. There’s a lot of pragmatic wisdom in The Prince, all focused on achieving significant leadership goals. However, as the critics of its time so succinctly put it, one key message of the book is that, when it comes to leadership, “the ends justify the means.” Although it is now often regarded as an outdated manual for acquiring and maintaining power, some of the utilitarian conclusions that Machiavelli draws are very similar to how outcome-oriented leaders rationalize their achievements…</span>

                              <span>Does self-discipline always build character? Not necessarily.
Psychologist Sarah Schnitker explains why virtue grows best when rooted in purpose beyond the self. Through studies of marathon runners fundraising for clean water, she shows how pro-social and spiritual motivations—not just personal fitness goals—led to deeper growth in generosity, patience, and self-control.
This research challenges the idea that self-improvement alone leads to virtue. When moral purpose and shared meaning enter the picture, transformation becomes more than personal: it becomes relational and lasting.

                              <span>It’s a long way from planet Earth to the Universe’s edge.

The extent of the visible Universe now goes on for 46.1 billion light-years: the distance that light emitted at the instant of the Big Bang would be located from us today, after a 13.8 billion year journey. As time marches on, light that’s even farther away, that is still on its way to us, will eventually arrive: from slightly greater distances and with slightly greater redshifts. We see into the past when we look out to great distances because the light emitted from distant objects must traverse those great intergalactic distances at a finite speed: the speed of light.

This recipe is too off-the-beaten-track from a traditional Hawaiian poké for me to call it such and live with myself, but it is loosely based around the idea of one. It starts with seasoned sushi rice (which I could eat just by itself) and is topped with a variety of fun things to munch on such as salt- and lime-seasoned cabbage, edamame beans and glazed pieces of barbecued tempeh, all bound together with a gentle but perky sriracha sauce. Like many of us today, it borrows ideas from all over the world and is, I think, all the more delicious for it.

                              <span>Einstein’s theory of relativity is one of the most mind-bending theories ever devised. In it, moving clocks tick more slowly than stationary ones, and rulers shrink. Perhaps the most shocking consequence of all is that nothing can travel faster than light.
This last one is very disappointing to space enthusiasts, as it dooms their hopes of ever speedily exploring the cosmos. Space is vast, with the closest star located four light years away. Even a simple radio signal, which travels at the fastest speed possible, will take eight years to make a round trip.
The idea that there is a maximum speed is pretty counterintuitive; after all, in everyday experience, you can make a car go faster simply by stepping harder on the gas or upgrading to a sports car. In rocketry, you can just let the rocke…</span>

                              <span>Why do many of us struggle with exercise when it’s essential for our well-being? Evolutionary biologist Daniel Lieberman says that it’s not laziness: it’s evolution. 
For most of human history, conserving energy was of utmost importance: The key to survival: motion without purpose would be a waste.
Lieberman explains why modern fitness feels unnatural, why guilt-driven workouts will always fail, and what hunter-gatherer lifestyles reveal about health today.

                              <span>The story of the expanding Universe has been a back-and-forth one over the past 110 years: ever since general relativity was first introduced. Initially, Einstein introduced the notion of a cosmological constant — a form of energy inherent to the fabric of space itself — to prevent a matter-filled Universe from collapsing. When we discovered that the Universe was expanding, the constant disappeared, eventually leading Einstein to declare it his biggest blunder. Then in the 1990s, a surprising collection of data indicated that the Universe’s expansion was accelerating, a discovery that revived the cosmological constant. The combination of supernova, cosmic microwave background, and large-scale structure data all appeared to demand it.
But now, more than 25 years later, an interesting set of…</span>

This is, nevertheless, a surprisingly tiny percentage of Earth history. For the first 90% of Earth history, the planet’s face was entirely untouched by flame. This is because it takes three things to make a fire.
The spark. For all of Earth history, lightning has been zapping the surface, today at the rate of 100 strikes a second. And for the entire history of fire on planet Earth, the vast majority of fires have been set by these bolts from the blue. Astoundingly, though, even at the rate of 100 strikes a second, human pyrophilia today far outpaces lightning, with 84% of the world’s blazes set by people (not counting the controlled fires in every fossil-fueled power plant, furnace, and engine on…</span>

Gibson called an “ambient optic array” — the structured pattern of light reaching your eyes. Light reflects off surfaces, passes through the cornea and lens, and lands on the retina, where photons trigger the photoreceptors that kick off neural processing.
Of course, we do not see a world of individual photons. We see a world of meaningful things — things that we build with, cook with, play with, fight with, and use. Gibson argued that we see the world in terms of “affordances,” where we see objects as opportunities for action. We think, “What can I use this thing for?” and “What’s it good at?”

In a Noema essay, the forest ecologist and author Suzanne Simard explores how trees offer us a different kind of wisdom: they are part of a living intelligence, bound together through underground networks of fungi that share carbon, nutrients, and even resilience across species.
The forest, in other words, is a society. It thrives because the community adapts, shares, and endures together. Perhaps that realization may feel like a mirror for our own lives. “Ecosystems are similar to human societies — they’re built on relationships,” she wri…</span>

Nobel laureate Paul Nurse unpacks Darwin’s insights, from the logic of tiny differences to the profound impacts these variations have on our understanding of life.
Nurse explores the deep genetic connections linking all organisms, from humans to gorillas to yeast. This shared ancestry, he argues, reframes how we think about responsibility: If all life is related, what do we owe to the living world?

On January 26, 1999, Cameron Barrett — who ran a website called Camworld — pondered the meaning of a new term he’d recently discovered:
“A few months back, I heard the term weblog for the first time. I&#x27;m not sure who coined it or where it came from, so I can&#x27;t properly credit it.

If you listen to any one of a number of disillusioned high-energy physicists (or wannabe physicists), you might conclude that it is. After all, the 20th century was a century of theoretical triumphs: we were able, on both subatomic and cosmic scales, to at last make sense of the Universe that surrounded and comprised us. We figured out what the fundamental forces and interactions governing physics were, what the fundamental constituents of matter were, how they assembled to form the world we observe and inhabit, and how to predict what the results of any experiment performed with those quanta would be.
Combined, the Standard Model of elementary particles and the standard model of cosmology represent the culmination of 20th century physics. Wh…</span>

                              <span>What if the secret to a happier life wasn’t constant joy, but something far more balanced?
Psychiatrist Robert Waldinger, MD, psychologist Tal Ben-Shahar, PhD, and author-entrepreneur Peter Baumann share what 85 years of research and lived experience reveal about happiness. They explain why chasing it directly often backfires—and how strong relationships, mindfulness, and embracing every emotion can build a baseline of positivity that actually lasts.

Back in 2015, humanity didn’t know whether a core prediction of Einstein’s general relativity — the existence of energy-carrying gravitational waves — was true or not. We had theoretical predictions that these waves should be generated whenever a massive object moved and accelerated through a changing gravitational field, and we had observed orbital decay of binary systems (like binary pulsars) that were consistent with those predictions, but the ripples in spacetime themselves, or gravitational waves, had never been directly detected. For 100 years, this great prediction of physics remained unconfirmed.
Then, on September 14, 2015, all of that changed. The twin LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Obs…</span>

                              <span>BowieWorld, via mutant ratz on YouTube.
In January 1999, BowieNet members were sent a CD that contained software for BowieWorld, a 3D chat environment built by a company called Worlds.com. It was a basic version of what Second Life would eventually launch in 2003 — a virtual world in which cartoonish three dimensional avatars roamed a blocky world and text-chatted with each other.
BowieWorld still exists today, albeit in a zombie state. In 2022, Worlds.com attempted to kick-start it again with an NFT promotion, launched at the 2022 David Bowie World Fan Convention. However, there have been no further updates since then. A Reddit community for Worlds.com shows it still has fans, but recent entries complain of server issues and “total radio silence” from the company.

Portals were certainly the biggest internet story of 1998. In November of that year, an entire episode of The Internet Cafe, a tv show hosted by Stewart Cheifet, Jane Wither and Andrew DeVries, was devoted to portals. In the introduction, DeVries gave this explanation of what a portal was.
