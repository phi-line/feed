                              <span>++OFFICIAL COUNCIL DOCUMENT - TOP SECRET - DO NOT DISSEMINATE++
 Name: Orion Jordan 
 Titles/Aliases: Ori 
 Age: 1 (almost 2)
 Species: Firbolg 
 Gender: Male
 Nationally: Unknown (possibly Greek)
 Magical Specialism: None
 Known Weaknesses: Getting hit by most nonmagical attacks, Peach allergy 
 Caster Grade: Adept
 Council Loyalty Classification: Red
 Threat Level: Delta
 Overview: The unusual amount of IQ he was born with is truly fascinating. Although he always claims to be very powerful and should be respected people always treat him as they would treat a normal baby with pats hugs ect. He normally isn&#x27;t much of a threat as he is what you would call &quot;lawful good&quot; although if pissed off he can deal some mediocre damage. He seriously hates crime and wants to take law into his own hands when possible to &quot;deliver justice&quot;. It should be noted that most of the times he wants to do that he has no way of finding the &quot;target&quot; and isn&#x27;t strong enough to beat them anyways. It is noteworthy that two other versions of himself Noiro and Oriana live inside his brain, Noiro is Orion&#x27;s evil version, he is &quot;chaotic evil&quot;. Oriana on the other hand is more erotically active and a menace to those around her, she is neutral.
 Contingencies: It should be noted that if Orion was to be faced with some kind of serious criminal his justice sence would overcome him and he would create incredibly powerful &quot;justice blasts&quot;. In addition if he were to somehow grow up momentarily (for example with an aging potion) he would get notably more powerful.
