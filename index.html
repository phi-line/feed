He&#x27;d decided the tree wasn&#x27;t going to do anything any time soon so he may as well do something useful. He reached into a rift, and pulled out the book he&#x27;d stolen from the mansion he burnt to ash. &#x27;The Tyrants Fist&#x27; wasn&#x27;t much to look at. Plain black cover, grey words, yet anyone could tell something was wrong with it. It just felt wrong. If Peri was right, and he was having visions of an alternate Alaric, he needed to know what he was up against. He opened the book.

 Everyday is to perform divine messanger duties after waking up so could have some time off on end of the day to work hard to improve myself as a divine messanger kitsune, after day of hard work deservers a bath in the onsen in land of kitsunes near the head temple of divine messangers.
 Sometimes duties are small, so I have more time for myself, hence I go visit a shrine I am guarding from evil spirits and protect those vulnerable from such spirits and assist them with their everyday work. Its not as easy as it looks to be divine messanger, but I chose this path as great kitsune, Oka, my master, took me under her wing and with her encouragement passed divine messanger exam and thus I&#x27;ve been divine messanger for 1900 years.
 I do not regret a thing as what I have dedicated myself to do, to help others and defend the weak.
 It is not easy to be a divine messanger.

                              <span>Atriox was disgruntled. He hadn’t had a good idea in a while. So he stretched and decided to visit his hoard, something that rarely happened these days. He hadn’t long lost his lust for gold and silver and other precious metals due to his being an earth dragon that could simply call the metals out of the earth on a whim. Still he kept it around for sentimental reasons.
 As the colossal dragon strode through the cavern his eyes paused on one of the more odd and disdainful pieces in his hoard, an Orb of Dragonkind. The orb was a weapon that wizards had crafted to trap and kill his kind. It made him snarl in rage at the thought and swept past. How would those upstart mages like it if they were… if they were…
 Atriox’s fangs bared themselves in a malicious grin.
 Thre Days Later
 An orb puts out a call. It has all the answers to the questions that wizards have asked for millennia as well as answers to questions that were never thought to be asked. For a thousand miles in every direction magic users feel the orb’s wisdom and secrets whispering to them. And they feel compelled to come to the peak of the mountain where it rests.
 Far below Atriox grins in wait, ready to trigger the ancient volcano that had been dormant for hundreds of thousands of years. he just had to wait a little while longer for the Orb of Wizardkind to do its job of luring them in.
