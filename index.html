                              <span>The way through treacherous weather in the woods would&#x27;ve been rough to walk knee deep snow, walking was difficult and yet there were dangers beneath the snow, slippery ice and rocks hidden bemeath the fluffy nd crunchy layers of snow.. The Northern lights glowed in the cloudless night sky amongst the moon as they reflected from frozen puddles of ice.. 
 However as one reached a downhill, they would&#x27;ve been met by an onsen, in midst of nowhere, but seemed to have some activity as there were lights on as the wind had calmed down. As one entered the onsen, they were welcomed by warmth and smell of burning pine and sense of rest. But then a woman appeared from behind some curtains in a kimono with diamond patterns, her hair was white, as it flew behind her back over kimono, her eyes golden, a big and fluffy tail showed itself from beneath the kimono behind her, her fox ears twitched on top of her head. 
 &quot;Ah, customers..&quot; 
 a warm smile appeared over her face.
 &quot;There havent been many customers for centuries,baths are open, rooms open. Would you like to rest and relax here before you continue your journeys?&quot;
 The kitsune asked with welcoming and warm smile..

 In the repertoire of Yan summons is a man laying in a cell. He was once clothed in rags but they rotted away long ago 
 On his head is a metalic box linked to his muscular body covered in scars by chains nailed directly inside of his flesh
 All exept one chain , hanging from his torso , are attached to the head
 All summons have a past
 There was once a man , a god , a father
 Of his love he made the world , of his love he made his family and of his love he made the animals to live among his creation
 His children were gods , worshipe…</span>

                              <span>Bur Oaks are drought and fire resistant due to their long tap roots and thick bark! The trees can live for hundreds of years and only start producing acorns around 35 years old. The acorns are edible and have been used as a food source for as long as people have been in the americas. 
 I didn’t have room for it, but I personally think the Bur Oak has some of the most beautiful leaves, flowers, and bark of any oak tree (you should google it it’s really pretty, you can see some pics on the Morton Arboretum site here) 
 /uw are you in the Chicago area and want to check out some beautiful trees in person? Try the Morton Arboretum or consider donating today! They’ve got science and art exhibits, a maze garden, and social events pretty much every week!

 Her brother to do what he should have done?
 To not be the kind of person she hates?
 A &quot;Lazy Villain&quot;, she used to say.
 But...
 Flufferson: Where is he?
 Waddel: I-I don&#x27;t know, Mom-I mean, Fluff-
 Flufferson: WHERE IS MY BROTHER, YOU-
 Oni holds back Flufferson, who was attempting to cast a spell.
 Oni: What even happened?
 Waddel: YOU HEARD THE NEWS! THE ZOMBIES? EARTH&#x27;S EMBRACE?
 Flufferson: He-he&#x27;s innocent. I know it. I BLOODY KNOW IT. NOW TELL ME WHERE YOU TOOK HIM-
 Waddel: I DON&#x27;T KNOW, EITHER!
 Flufferson: You&#x27;re useless. I&#x27;ll find someone else, and they&#x27;ll tell me.
 Flufferson pushes Waddel out of the way, as she runs off. Oni following.
 Oni: FLUFF!
 Geralt sits in a tree, overlooking a city.
 Geralt: ...You broke me out?
 Heresy: Yep!
 Geralt: Why?
 Heresy: There&#x27;s something I need to do before I leave you alone.
 Geralt: ...You mean me and the rest of Fluffco?
 Heresy: ...You could say that.
 Geralt: ...What?
 Heresy: ...The surprise makes it better.

 Eukarya’s night sky is a beautiful sight that is inescapable. Once Shadeholme conquered the colony under Sylvane, a smaller Well of Shadows was constructed on a metal platform in the middle of the Silver Bay. It was that day Sylvane declared the Shadeholme confederation into the Ce’Darian Empire, and ever since that day the Well there has remained active.
 This is the first time she will see it. Rose had scheduled a visit to the Well under “a duty of the office…</span>

                              <span>Living in Freetown was strange to say the least. At first glance it was a nice place, friendly residents, easy to find or give help. But then you&#x27;d give it a second look and start to notice things. Things like the religious monument in the exact center of the city, or the 30 dragon children walking around, or the celestial god building houses for peasants. But despite the circumstances, it is quite a nice place to live, even with Dominox establishing a rip off Erdtree in the lake. It wasn&#x27;t the perfect place to live, but it was a good enough place for reality altering draconic children to grow up.
 One such child, Kriiddorahjun had aged surprisingly fast compared to his siblings. Where the others were nearing the age of toddlers, or five year olds, he was approaching eight years old. Shock…</span>

There was no sun to study to watch rise and Fall only the dim and ancient ceiling light that barely let the room. She tried listening to the footsteps of the person responsible for feeding her to find any regularity in her arrivals to hopefully keep track of time that way but the schedule seemed to change randomly in a seemingly deliberate attempt to mess with their sense of time. Even her multi-tools clock was useless, its hands rapidly spinning both clockwise and counterclockwise at seemingly random intervals. 
 The boredom was the second worst part of it. She only had her school supplies to keep her entertained and they had taken the spiral notebook labeled spellbook des…</span>
