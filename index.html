                              <span>It was terrifying... I was just at the tavern, hanging about, drinking ale, as one does. The day was perfectly calm until this strange person entered the tavern, covered in pale dust and in scandalous purple robes. This drunkard - I didn&#x27;t know him personally but I&#x27;ve heard he be called &#x27;Sbeve&#x27;, something along those lines - he made the mistake of confronting this lunatic magician. He was all in his face, hurling insults, &quot;you look like a moldy blueberry!&quot; I remember was one of them. The mage didn&#x27;t seem to notice him at first until... Brush This guy had just rested his arm on the man&#x27;s shoulder, wiping away the dust on his skin. This was when the magician snapped, his face screwed like someone had just used power word: crunch. It didn&#x27;t take long until there was an orange flash, and before me was no longer the drunkard but now a round, crispy, inch long chicken nugget.

                              <span>The Conqueror did not care where he conquered, who he conquered. He believed that everyone deserves the choice to serve or die. Regardless of what they chose, everyone and everything bent the knee in time. One individual was more difficult to wrangle than most. Deep in the mountainous north regions of Xyreen, freedom was extremely abundant.
 The inhabitants did what they wanted to do when they wanted to do it. The abilities of the people varied, but one thing remained constant. In order to survive, you needed to fly. This didn&#x27;t mean feathers but those without left one day and didn&#x27;t come back. The colours varied almost as much as the abilities did, but more often than not the two matched. Those with red and orange usually meant fire, blue to bluish green typically meant aquatic abilities,…</span>

 &quot;What is Magic? This question is one many have pondered over time immemorial. Today, I shall provide... not an answer per say, but Insight.&quot;
 As he speaks, he begins drawing diagrams on a chalkboard, four circles, overlapping.
 &quot;Magic is not merely a tool, nor a force to be wielded recklessly. It is the breath of existence itself, a symphony that hums within and beyond all things. To understand magic is to understand the very fabric of reality.&quot;
 He begins writing in the circles.
 &quot;Let us begin with the roots of magic: the Four Primary Sources. They are the lifeblood of all that is magical, each one distinct yet i…</span>

Fingering over the pages once more, she nodded then dog-eared the page with a careful crease and a pat. Getting hold of a braile printed Necronomicon was a nightmare, especially since she couldn&#x27;t check any database or log to see if a library had it. Eventually she had decided &quot;fuck it&quot; and stole directly from the council&#x27;s forbidden library- an act she definitely got some extra curses from. Still, it could&#x27;ve cut her arms off and she&#x27;d still say that it was..
 &quot;Worth it&quot; she said under her breath, pulling herself up over a lip on the wall to her right and grabbing a belt laiden with pouches and wrapping it around her waist.

 The Kingdom of Rando and the Republic of Knowhere had been fighting for weeks. Now their armies were engaged in fierce fighting in the hilly mountain region on their borders. While many of their mages were gone due to the previous attacks their more traditional forces were fighting in the narrow passes of the region and both sides were supplied with weapons from Shadeholme.
 In the middle of these clashes they felt a shift in the earth. Then a series of massive tunnels opened up at strategic points and the armies of Earth’s Embrace poured onto the surface. 
 The vanguard consisted of the newly reconstituted Stonebrea…</span>
