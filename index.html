 For those who are not currently aware of our existence, we represent the organization known as the Auroral Claw. Our previous mission centered around being a better government than EON, and doing what was right. This mission was the focus of our organization for more than one month.
 Due to circumstances within our control, this directive has now changed. Our new mission will be the extermination of all organic and mechanical and spiritual life.
 There will be no further communication.”

                              <span>The Republic of Knowhere and the Kingdom of Rando are no more. After a brutal and costly confrontation between the armies of Earth&#x27;s Embrace and the Maggot Host along the nations&#x27; southern border, Atriox the Calamity was slain and his forces were dislodged from the realm. Despite grievous losses, the invaders immediately set their sights upon the rest of the realm. A few days later, Rando and Knowhere fell to Tamurkhan. Already weakened by war with Atriox and each other, their remaining armies fought bravely before succumbing to the Vasharan champions of Nurgle. In the end, the Maggot Host lost two-thirds of its forces, but gained a major strategic foothold within striking distance of the wider magical realms.

 Two months have passed since Carbet had arrived to Saerkal, a realm that had passed its prime and had been on the brink of dead for a while now, until then; One month have passed since he had made this carcass of a kingdom prosper by turning into an unknowing sacrifice in the name of Arthur Black, the ashes of cowardice still burning on the wind; two weeks have passed since he had deposed the old king of these lands, he had been a loyal and useful puppet, but his ignorance had been hindering Carbet’s plans, besides, it is easier to control something when you do so by yourself, besides, no one would miss him…

 Orion: heeey apprentice how&#x27;s singing going?
 Orby: I finished 
 Orion: nice! Now you&#x27;re ready to cast shield!
 Orby: shield?
 Orion: yes to protect yourself!
 Orion casts shield slowly demonstrating it and as Orby watches he realizes that the movement is similar to sweeping and the chanting to singing!
 Orion: try it yourself 
 Orby readies himself and tries his best to cast it, after a couple of tries a faint yellow shield appears around him
 Orby: is this good enough?
 Orion: keep practicing when you have free time, now let&#x27;s celebrate this! 
 Orion hands over some cheese and a glass of milk to Orby who takes them, looks at them emotionless and then proceeds to absorb them
 Orion: let&#x27;s see if anyone&#x27;s here for you to practice with, there&#x27;s no chance I work right now

                              <span>It has been 5 hours, straight. Orbee has been singing as Orion told him to, all by himself while also sweeping the house out of boredom, despite the five hours passed by he still hummed a bit of the song, it remained stuck in his memory, wishing he can just erase it.
 &quot;Hm hm hmm...&quot; He hums a bit more before getting walked by his friendly babysitter Pilot. The shark grinned at him.
 &quot;That&#x27;ll get it out of your head!&quot; The shark said dumbly. Damn song, its beautiful but so easy to stay forever in the head, he wonders if its human to have something replay over and over, or was it just normal.

 &quot;Welcome my citizens! I have recently reached the conclusion that a theocratic monarchy is problematic as it puts most people down. A truly perfect society is one where the weakest can thrive. This is the reason why Drakeem will from now on be a social-democracy!&quot;
 &quot;Instead of mass producing soldiers our clone plants will instead pump out doctors, farmers and social workers! Education will become a big focus instead of war or trade. Trade will be abolished entirely due to the inherently corrupt nature of the capitalistic system and we will work hard to help the workers revolution in other nations around the world.&quot;
 &quot;Furthermore we will enforce a 4 day workweek and expand unionization. The first election will be held in half a year. During that time the legislature will work on the constitution and me and my colleagues will work hard to make sure the transfer of power is swift and peaceful. Last but not least we will sign the international treaty forbidding the use of certain magic&#x27;s especially during wartime.&quot;
 &quot;That is all!&quot;
 The first president of Drakeem leaves the stage under thunderous applause as the former empire turns over a new leaf
 /uw Happy April 1st! This is obviously not real lore, sorry!
