                              <span>I&#x27;ve grown quite keen to dragons through my quite extensive research and studies, but since some lower denomination of time, I&#x27;ve realized that a question what a dragon is, is still left unanswered, which for a person like me is more than frustrating.
 By that, I mean are dragons more like fish, or like crabs. Since there is not really a close connection to many creatures we call dragons, like wyverns, jabberwocks, hydras, giant snails, snake like wyrms or even true dragons, either the western or eastern variety, which are more closely related. All of those creatures are called dragons, and it&#x27;s mostly due to they&#x27;re similar features, or so many people think, since what are those similar features actually. 
 Lizard like appearance is common, but there are many dragons with slug like appear…</span>

It represents the ultimate blend of internal mastery, external natural forces, mortal ingenuity, and divine will. At its essence lies magic in its purest form, transcending all boundaries and limitations. This is the realm of Universalism, the rare and awe-inspiring practice that channels the totality of existence into raw power. Let’s delve into its intricacies.
 The Nature of the Convergence At the Central Convergence, the distinct boundaries between the sources dissolve. Practitioners do not simply wield fragments of Arcane, Primal, Occult, or Divine magic—they become vessels for the unified essence of all magic. This convergence is unfilter…</span>

                              <span>An abhorrent curse, especially for those with sensory issues. Everything without exception tastes, smells, and feels like mayonnaise. Even the darkest and foulest of beings fear this curse.
 The one cure being to find the closest jar of mayonnaise, and to eat all of the contents of the mayonnaise jar in one sitting.
 If there is no mayonnaise available to you, after 1 hour the curse becomes permanent.
