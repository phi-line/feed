 &quot;Hello... It&#x27;s certainly been a while, hasn&#x27;t it?&quot; I asked the familiar figure standing in the lush garden meadow.
 He gasped like he&#x27;d just seen a ghost, stumbling backward. &quot;Ithael?! What—&quot; He shouted, cutting himself off to glance around at the other angels before whispering, &quot;What the hell are you doing here?!&quot;
 Not the response I expected. &quot;W- Well, I suppose I wasn&#x27;t happy with how we left off...&quot;
 &quot;No fucking shit! You stabbed me, you dick!&quot; He pulled the collar of his shirt down to reveal an ever-familiar scar on his neck. &quot;And now what— you&#x27;re here after god-knows-how-many years?! What have you been doing all this time?!&quot;
 This was... not going as smoothly as I had hoped. &quot;Let&#x27;…</span>

A figure sat on the floor, meticulously and methodically brushing various precise strokes on two pieces of paper. She sat the calligraphy brush down on her desk and started folding the strips of paper into artful manikins. The figure held each manikin in her fingers and wisps of smoke came from them. The manikins burst into flames, quickly burning through each of them. From the ashes, two new female humanoids emerged. They had black hair that was neatly tied behind their heads and wore plain white kimono. Their expressions were completely neutral as well. All in all, they possessed no remarkable features, essentially perfect blank slates.
 The figure stood up from the floor and opened the shutters. She turned back to her shikigami…</span>

                              <span>Dark tidings have come to the realms of late. The ancient Nurglite champion Tamurkhan has arisen in the far south, rallying the malevolent Vashar civilization to his banner with promises of deicide and revenge against magekind. The Maggot Lord plans to conquer the magical world as an offering to the Plaguelord so that he can at last ascend as a daemon prince and claim the legendary Throne of Chaos. Yet hope endures, for a Vasharan defector named Ashurhaddon Ka’al has brought us vital information concerning Tamurkhan’s warhost. Combined with our own auguries, we have managed to get a rough idea of the doctrine and organization of his forces well ahead of his planned invasion.
 As the Maggot Host’s ranks swell with Chaos-marked warriors from the Vasharan realms and beyond, Tamurkhan knows he…</span>
