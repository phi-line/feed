 Thomas’s morning was probably the most peaceful that he’s had in a while. He was sitting in a recliner reading the paper. It talked about a military project being finished. He didn’t really understand it nor did he really care.
 Thomas looks over at Jay. He was sleeping on the sofa. Now that he thinks about it, this was probably the most peaceful morning the kid had in his entire life. He actually got to sleep in, he wasn’t traveling to some other island, and he wasn’t sleeping in the woods on his own. Now that he thought about it, he started to notice how much Jay hated mornings.
 Thomas chuckles to himself and goes back to reading his paper. At least he did until he heard a knock on the door. Thomas groans in annoyan…</span>

 The Kingdom of Rando and the Republic of Knowhere had been fighting for weeks. Now their armies were engaged in fierce fighting in the hilly mountain region on their borders. While many of their mages were gone due to the previous attacks their more traditional forces were fighting in the narrow passes of the region and both sides were supplied with weapons from Shadeholme.
 In the middle of these clashes they felt a shift in the earth. Then a series of massive tunnels opened up at strategic points and the armies of Earth’s Embrace poured onto the surface. 
 The vanguard consisted of the newly reconstituted Stonebrea…</span>

                              <span>Among Yan&#x27;s summon some are given the rank of favorite. One of those favorite is the seraphim larvae. A creature tougher than even the enslaved god
 Seraphim are superior celestial creature. They take the form of a montain sized bird with a snake like body and multiple sets of wings. Among the celestials they are the ones that posses the best planshifting abilities. Abilities that are at the very heart of their reproductive cycle
 They reproduce in the celestial realms but the only place they lay their eggs in is the deep layers of the abyss where the demon grow so big and strong that the most powerfull of them claim the title of demi god
 But once they are born the larvae have no predators
 They are born as tall and as long as a train with 4 wagons 
 Their fluff make them imunue to heat up to 6000000 K and down to 0 K 
 It is also a perfect electricity , humidity and magical isolant 
 The skin under it is 30 cm thick and extremely solid , the muscle fibers are stronger than spider silk fibers and are so thick that even when dead the larvae require more than 50 t of pressure to lift one of its leg a few millimetres . Dead they stand like statue for the rest of eternity
 In the abyss , killing a seraphim larvae is considered an exploit worthy of aquiring the status of demi god

                              <span>It was a year ago where I summoned myself a welcoming taco and it shall be today where I summon myself a graduation taco.
 It was a ...strange year here in this sub with many ups and downs, incredible amounts of joy but also heartbreak which I managed to overcome thanks to the help of others, some very valuable insight on myself and the chance to meet incredible friends along the way which I hold very close to me.
 ...but I think it is time to make it official. This is my last post on WP and its related subs. For the related chats I am in I will stay in as I like the community behind them very much. It stopped being fun and to be fair, I&#x27;m surprised that I even made it this long.
 Anyhow, before this takes on a huge scale I will head out and enjoy the taco.
 Have yourself a good one and a final Logotu out :3
