 Arach paces around her office as one of her kin continues to explain the situation. The spider had entered the office already shaking with fear, and anxiety had only worsened since his entrance.

 There&#x27;s the thing.
 Even if Flufferson basically disowned him...
 He sure as shit wasn&#x27;t letting Heresy go easy.

 Heresy was ready.
 The sacrifices were ready, Oni was...probably dead. Who knows.

I cannot figure out as to why, but he is using a castle shaped golem to attack my shop. My barrier is currently holding back the physical attacks, im worried about the large canon in the center of the golem. it&#x27;s been charging mana for several minutes now and i don&#x27;t believe my barrier will hold through that much power. do any of you have suggestions as to how to stop or absorb the attack?

                              <span>An abhorrent curse, especially for those with sensory issues. Everything without exception tastes, smells, and feels like mayonnaise. Even the darkest and foulest of beings fear this curse.
 The one cure being to find the closest jar of mayonnaise, and to eat all of the contents of the mayonnaise jar in one sitting.
 If there is no mayonnaise available to you, after 1 hour the curse becomes permanent.
