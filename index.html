After having finished his allotted share of reports, forms, and bureaucracy, he had begun heading home and clearing his head of all the work throughout the day. Until he noticed someone. They… somewhat resembled the late Professor Friezen. Vanio blinked and he could quickly see it was just a stranger, no one he knew. Though disturbed, he continued walking on. Merely 5 steps later, he had to pause and check if he had heard her voice. Vanio quickened his pace.

                              <span>Ace walks into an empty building, on nobody&#x27;s territory. It took him a while to find such a spot, but shortly thereafter, he set the place up with cameras and printers, and posters started going out. They read &quot;Hey, Cultists! Want to prove your god is as good as you say? Then FIGHT ME. If your god&#x27;s will can&#x27;t take out one of my bodies, then is he even a god?! Come to [insert address here], and take me on! I&#x27;m not in short supply of these bodies!&quot;, and have a picture of the building and of Ace. From there, he waits for a challenger.
 /uw/ Pic unrelated. This post is mostly meant for anyone playing Dominox or his cultists, but I&#x27;d welcome a duel with any other cultists or cult leaders.
