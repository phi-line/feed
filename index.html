 Scientific Classification: Unknown
 Average Size: Estimated to exceed 300 meters in length
 Known Habitat: The abyssal trenches of the Black Lake; recently sighted in the deepest parts of the open ocean
 Threat Level: Catastrophic 
 Description 
 Bathysoth is among the largest known entities to have emerged from the Black Lake’s depths. Its original form is unidentifiable, though remnants of skeletal structure suggest it may have once belonged to an ancient leviathan species. Now, it is a thing of abyssal hunger—its form a nightmarish fusion of flesh and void, shifting between an armored, chitinous exterior and a mass of writhing tendrils that extend like abyssal currents. 
 Its face is a hollowed maw, lined with concentric rings of bioluminescent lures t…</span>

                              <span>I rub my fingers together to create simple sparks that each dissipate with a tiny snap. Next I cast a Continuation spell on one, which becomes a persistent tiny mote that emits a steady crackle and glow. Finally I create an orange tinted disc of force, then bubble the permanent spark through it two times.
 This two layered design with a perpetual spark core is certainly easier to produce, and it&#x27;s the perfect throwing size. Unfortunately I expect it could take a while to charge. I cast a Time Acceleration spell to hasten the charging, by far the most taxing magic I&#x27;ve yet cast today. While not strictly necessary, it will expedite testing greatly.
 I catch my breath from the exertion of accelerating time once the orange test grenade becomes slightly warm. I casually toss it a short ways away where it explodes with a loud crack, like a small firework. &quot;Impressive amplification considering it came from squaring just a spark.&quot; I remark. &quot;Let&#x27;s try more layers.&quot;
 I create a new spark grenade and start adding more layers of orange superradiant sheilding. At the seventh I reckon any more would make it inconveniently large. I have to charge it in two casts of Time Acceleration because I need to take a break. Though the charging only takes several seconds real time it&#x27;s exhausting for me to sustain the spell.
 Once I&#x27;ve caught my breath we&#x27;re ready to test. &quot;Spark to the seventh power. Ready?&quot; I glance back at my Simulacrum and it gives me a thumbs-up, so I toss the melon sized orange sphere as far as I can manage.

And then my predecessor had engraved runes from a foreign land(chinese letters) onto it which read &quot;lucky stone&quot;. And it&#x27;s said it had served him well as such.

Their purpose, to figure out why and how the Guild stole the information to create the Lightless Flame detectors they have evidently managed to duplicate.
