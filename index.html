                              <span>Orion was shocked at Atriox&#x27;s appearance since everyone had him for dead. He had to do something to protect the empire of boom and it had to be done fast. He studied ancient books and scrolls... At the local library. 
 Of course that didn&#x27;t get him far but he learnt the spell summon stone elemental. Although because of his age it wasn&#x27;t really powerful he saw potential in it. He spent a whole week casting it every evening and had managed to create an army of 10.000.000.
 It was a small but needed step to survive Atriox&#x27;s inevitable attack.

 Description:

Their faces are obscured by barnacle-encrusted masks—once resembling the carved visages of old fishermen, but now warped beyond recognition. Beneath these masks, no discernible facial features have been found, only endless black v…</span>
