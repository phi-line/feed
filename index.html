                              <span>*Golem Guardians, Inc. - Disclaimer of Responsibility
 &quot;By acquiring or activating any golem from Golem Guardians, Inc., you, the esteemed wizard, acknowledge and accept full and unyielding responsibility for all actions, reactions, and potential pandemonium that may arise from said golem&#x27;s deployment. This includes, but is certainly not limited to: * Unforeseen Rampages: Should your golem develop an unexpected fondness for smashing local produce stands or engaging in impromptu demolition derbies, Golem Guardians, Inc. accepts precisely zero culpability. * Sentience Surprises: If your golem suddenly develops a penchant for philosophical debates or existential angst, please consult your local arcane therapist, not us. * Accidental Transmutation: Should your golem accidentally turn your prize-winning toad into a teacup (or vice versa), we suggest a strongly worded letter to the golem, as we are not liable. * Misinterpreted Commands: If your golem interprets &quot;fetch&quot; as &quot;rearrange the city skyline,&quot; you&#x27;ll find our customer service line remarkably busy. * Emotional Outbursts: Golems, despite their impenetrable exteriors, can be sensitive. If yours decides to express its feelings by burying your rival wizard in a pile of pebbles, that&#x27;s between you and your local constable.
 In essence, you are the golem&#x27;s master, and thus, its master&#x27;s responsibility. Golem Guardians, Inc. provides the golem; you provide the common sense (hopefully). May your golem serve you well, and may your insurance cover any collateral damage.
 Golem Guardians, Inc. - We build &#x27;em, you break &#x27;em (possibly).&quot;
 Scry yours today!

                              <span>Lately I&#x27;ve been unable to sleep well.
 I keep having this weird dream.
 I&#x27;m in the beach with my friends.
 We play and laugh together.
 Then a great wave forms on the horizon.
 I try to run, but my legs refuse to obey.
 The wave keeps getting bigger, covering the sun.
 And then I wake up.
 &quot;Bro is gonna make it!&quot;
 The youths cheered and laughed as Caspian kept climbing the palm tree, he tried to hide his own fear with bravado, but the truth was, he had never been a fan of heights.
 &quot;You better prepare that gem Dylan! I&#x27;m almost at the top!&quot;
 That was the reason why he was doing this, Dylan had an impressive collection of rocks and other baubles he had collected from all across their island, including a particularly nice gem, nice enough to be the perfect present for a certain person.

                              <span>This reality is home to countless worlds and realms. Some need special entrances, some need special portals, some can be stumbled into by any unlucky explorer.
 One day a group of cavers were gearing up for a spelunking session. They&#x27;d recently found a wonderful cave called the crevice of darkness and despair. A perfect place to go down. One by one they squeezed through the crack in the rock. Instantly they were surrounded in darkness. Not an issue in the slightest, all of them knew basic light spells. They lit up some of spells and looked around.
 Nothing remarkable, big crack on one side of the chamber, a passage further down on the other. They&#x27;d gone in, now they went further. Down the passage they found a sudden drop off into a river. Very strong current. They needed to be careful. Slo…</span>

His face is scarred and hardened, obsidian-like cracks formed across his grey complexion. Flickers of recognition course behind his ghostly silver eyes. Memories of an age long ago, of a life long since dead. Yet, the flames of resentment burn as bright as ever.
 His reminiscing is broken on arrival. A massive, black temple bleeds into reality, floating on this sea of nothing like a slumbering giant. Another figure, clad in similar robes and a mechanical mask, waits on a precipice overlooking the void. The grey man touches down on the obsidian slab, floating with an ethereal grace despite his wracked appearance. Still, his visage remains dark and …</span>
